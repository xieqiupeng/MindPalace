[00:08.89]Model Test 1
[00:11.21]Part III Listening Comprehension      
[00:14.83]Section A
[00:16.66]Directions: In this section, 
[00:19.40]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:22.04]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:24.86]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:26.69]one or more questions will be asked about what was said£®
[00:30.95]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:33.72]will be spoken only once. 
[00:35.92]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:39.36]During the pause, you must read the four choices 
[00:42.71]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:45.92]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:48.95]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 
[00:52.74]with a single line through the centre.
[00:56.05]Now let's begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:00.99]11. W: From your resume, 
[01:04.18]I can see you have a very good educational background. 
[01:07.84]But do you have any office working experience?
[01:10.95]M: I helped out in my dad's office during the summer holidays. 
[01:14.16]I did data entry, filing, answering the telephone, 
[01:17.40]that sort of thing.
[01:18.93]Q: What does the man mean?
[01:35.16]12. W: John, I remember you've mentioned 
[01:39.40]you want to go to Thailand for your vacation. 
[01:42.27]M: It would be too expensive. 
[01:43.92]Airfare alone would cost me a couple thousand dollars. 
[01:46.98]I do have to live within my means, after all.
[01:49.89]Q: What is the man probably going to do?
[02:07.73]13. W: Prof. Mitchell, I'm trying to get my head 
[02:12.31]around the choice of electives for the optional part 
[02:15.18]of the third year program.
[02:17.10]M: If I were you, 
[02:18.10]I'd really just go with what my interests are.
[02:21.05]Q: What are the speakers talking about?
[02:37.97]14. M: Sarah, your grades were initially fine 
[02:42.03]but started to drop off a bit towards the end of this semester.
[02:45.46]W: I really felt that the work I missed in those two lab sessions 
[02:49.39]have made it hard for me to understand 
[02:51.44]some of the underlying concepts. 
[02:54.08]Q: What can we learn about the woman?
[03:10.92]15. W: Hello Mr. Jones, sorry to bother you, 
[03:15.41]but my salary doesn't seem to have gone in.
[03:18.43]M: Oh Sheila, you started with us last month, didn't you? 
[03:21.90]Have you given your details to the accountant? 
[03:24.36]If so, I'll get him to look into it.
[03:27.17]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[03:44.65]16. W: I was made redundant in February, 
[03:48.79]so I've been trying to get a job.
[03:50.74]M: So have I. 
[03:51.76]I thought I would have found a job within three months. 
[03:54.79]I've never found it that difficult in the past.
[03:57.62]Q: How does the man feel about his current situation?
[04:15.91]17. W: What should we eat for dinner today? 
[04:19.91]How about hamburg?
[04:21.69]M: Well, I have been gaining a little weight lately. 
[04:24.86]I thought I had too much fast food. 
[04:27.14]So, I decided to turn over a new leaf 
[04:29.57]and started eating only fresh, healthy food.
[04:32.21]Q: What does the man imply?
[04:49.48]18. M: My wife's in hospital, 
[04:52.60]so I need to be with her. 
[04:54.11]But I only need to take a morning off.
[04:57.03]W: Well, if you only need a few hours, 
[04:59.64]why don't you come in early and stay late for a few days? 
[05:02.85]You can just make up the time.
[05:04.96]Q: What does the woman suggest the man do?
[05:22.05]Now you'll hear the two long conversations.
[05:25.41]Conversation One
[05:27.78]W: Today we have Matthew Turner here, 
[05:30.41]talking about roads and traffic. 
[05:33.16]Turner and his colleague studied traffic in 228 U.S. cities 
[05:38.77]and determined that the more roads you build, 
[05:41.59]the more traffic you create.
[05:43.86]M: Yes, what we found was that as you add roads to a city, 
[05:47.90]those roads get filled up. 
[05:49.78]There are people waiting to use that capacity.
[05:52.63]W: So it's almost like there's a long line of people 
[05:55.31]waiting to use that space on the freeway. 
[05:57.86]M: Right. There are a lot of people out there 
[06:00.43]trying to decide whether to make one more trip to the store 
[06:03.34]or drive a little further to work. 
[06:05.47]As you add a little bit more capacity, it gets filled up.
[06:08.99]W: This is going to sound very frustrating 
[06:11.47]to smart mayors all across America 
[06:14.19]because they're going to say: 
[06:15.73]What can I possibly do to ease traffic jam 
[06:18.61]if I can't build more roads? What can I do?
[06:22.17]M: We have really a small number of possible policy responses 
[06:25.78]to traffic jam. One is capacity increases, 
[06:29.12]one is public transit increases 
[06:31.87]and the third is special charges for driving into city center. 
[06:35.89]And what we've shown is that 
[06:37.99]the first two of those policy responses are unlikely to work, 
[06:41.44]which leaves the third approach.
[06:43.48]W: This is essentially charging people 
[06:46.15]to drive into a city or to use a road.
[06:48.89]M: That's exactly right, much in the same way 
[06:51.50]as they do in London or Singapore or Stockholm.
[06:54.59]W: In London, I think it costs about 10 pounds to go into the city. 
[06:59.47]M: We have enough experience with these programs now 
[07:02.12]to know that they really work. 
[07:03.87]In response to pretty small fees, 
[07:06.06]you see big reductions in travel time.
[07:10.24]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the conversation 
[07:14.24]you have just heard.
[07:17.82]19. What are the two speakers mainly talking about?
[07:36.65]20. Why is building roads useless to ease traffic jam 
[07:42.02]according to the man?
[07:58.51]21. What does the man think of charging people 
[08:02.03]for driving into city center?
[08:18.78]Conversation Two
[08:20.79]W: So, what are you going to do this summer?
[08:23.55]M: Well, I'm probably going to go on holiday with my parents 
[08:26.84]for a week. What about you?
[08:28.79]W: I'm going to Scotland.
[08:30.42]M: For the whole summer?
[08:31.73]W: Yes, well, I'm going for seven weeks. 
[08:34.69]I'm going to work in a youth hostel in the mountains.
[08:37.85]M: Really? That sounds great!
[08:39.63]W: Yes, I think so. 
[08:41.18]I mean, the work won't be very interesting. 
[08:44.12]But my hours are seven till ten in the morning 
[08:46.81]and five till nine in the evening, 
[08:49.08]so I'll have plenty of time during the day to go walking.
[08:52.03]M: That sounds fun! 
[08:53.11]It'll be like a holiday, but you'll be earning money too.
[08:56.29]W: Yes, it's also a chance to get out of the city 
[08:59.26]and maybe meet some new people.
[09:01.08]M: I wish I could get a job like that. 
[09:03.30]How did you find out about it?
[09:05.00]W: I read about it in a book called Summer Work Round Britain. 
[09:09.26]It tells you about all kinds of different jobs 
[09:12.02]in different places. 
[09:13.53]You can work at farms picking fruit, 
[09:15.71]or at hotels near the sea. 
[09:17.60]M: That's great. 
[09:18.44]So do you have to pay for your accommodation and food 
[09:21.48]in Scotland then?
[09:22.54]W: Well, it's quite good. 
[09:24.44]I'll be staying in a shared bedroom, 
[09:26.83]and they'll take ¡ê15 a week out of my wages to pay for that. 
[09:31.13]My breakfast will be free, 
[09:33.15]because I'll probably be cooking breakfast for the guests! 
[09:36.11]I can get dinner in the evening at a reduced price, 
[09:39.58]so I only have to worry about lunch.
[09:41.84]M: Well, I hope you have a great time.
[09:45.39]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the conversation 
[09:49.15]you have just heard.
[09:51.95]22. What has the man planned to do in summer?
[10:11.19]23. What do we learn about the woman¡¯s job?
[10:29.99]24. How did the woman find the job?
[10:48.07]25. What does the woman say about the accommodation and food?
[11:08.14]Section B
[11:09.43]Directions: In this section, 
[11:11.76]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:13.90]At the end of each passage, 
[11:15.81]you will hear some questions. 
[11:17.43]Both the passage and the questions 
[11:19.67]will be spoken only once. 
[11:21.77]After you hear a question, 
[11:23.69]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[11:26.62]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[11:30.09]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 
[11:33.78]with a single line through the centre.
[11:36.63]Passage One
[11:39.56]Before 1918, when Mississippi became the last U.S. state 
[11:43.79]to require that school-age children 
[11:45.70]attend public or private schools, 
[11:47.56]many children were taught by their parents at home 
[11:50.54]or by teachers informally hired by the community. 
[11:53.71]Quite often in rural areas, 
[11:55.66]kids of all ages were taught in the same one-room schoolhouse. 
[11:59.43]Decades later in the 1980s, 
[12:02.21]homeschooling made a comeback 
[12:03.98]when religiously conservative parents convinced states 
[12:07.30]to approve and give full credit 
[12:08.96]for the teaching of children at home. 
[12:11.09]The homeschooling movement has since broadened 
[12:13.52]to include parents of all faiths¡ªor no faith at all. 
[12:17.26]Thus, an estimated 1.5 million American children 
[12:20.96]won't be going anywhere as schools open for the fall term. 
[12:25.64]Instead, one or both of their parents 
[12:28.06]will gather books and other materials, prepare lesson plans, 
[12:31.93]and teach their children everything 
[12:33.93]right in their living rooms. 
[12:35.58]Adults who choose to stay home and teach their children 
[12:38.59]often object to standardized testing 
[12:41.14]and what they see as the regimented way 
[12:43.39]in which schools group students by age rather than ability, 
[12:47.11]and pass them ahead to the next grade 
[12:49.25]whether or not they've grasped the material. 
[12:51.89]In home-schooling households, 
[12:53.50]it's not unusual to find several children, aged 4 to 16, 
[12:58.57]being taught together. 
[12:59.96]Older kids help younger ones, 
[13:01.87]as they once did in those one-room schoolhouses. 
[13:05.16]Many home-taught students excel in several subjects 
[13:08.33]and have no trouble moving on to college, 
[13:10.58]often with academic scholarships in hand. 
[13:13.18]But critics point to home teachers' 
[13:15.34]lack of experience and qualifications. 
[13:17.79]They say no one's supervising them. 
[13:20.30]They also argue that pulling kids out of school 
[13:22.62]may deprive them of social skills.
[13:26.79]Questions 26 to 29 are based on the passage 
[13:30.67]you have just heard.
[13:33.62]26. According to the passage, 
[13:37.04]what was common in rural areas before 1918?
[13:55.23]27. What does the speaker say about the homeschooling movement?
[14:15.34]28. Why do parents give credit to homeschooling?
[14:34.22]29. Why do critics criticize homeschooling?
[14:54.75]Passage Two
[14:56.54]Louis Kahn is considered 
[14:58.22]one of the most important American building designers 
[15:01.18]of the 20th century. 
[15:03.60]Kahn's architecture has several defining qualities. 
[15:07.37]For example, Kahn was very interested 
[15:10.01]in the look and feel of the materials he used. 
[15:14.01]He used brick and concrete in new and special ways. 
[15:17.53]Kahn also paid careful attention to the use of sunlight. 
[15:21.41]He liked natural light to enter his buildings 
[15:24.39]through interesting kinds of windows and openings. 
[15:27.80]Kahn's work can also be identified 
[15:30.66]by his creative use of geometric shapes. 
[15:34.06]Many of his buildings use squares, 
[15:36.37]circles and three sided shapes called triangles. 
[15:40.55]Louis Kahn's buildings have many influences. 
[15:44.39]Some experts say his trip to Italy and Greece in 1951 
[15:48.60]influenced him the most. 
[15:50.82]There, he saw the ancient Greek and Roman ruins 
[15:53.78]that also would influence his works. 
[15:56.90]He was very affected by the size and design of these ruins. 
[16:00.81]They helped influence him to develop an architecture 
[16:03.84]that combines both modern and ancient designs. 
[16:07.31]Louis Kahn was an artist who created beautiful works. 
[16:11.09]But he was not a very good businessman. 
[16:14.21]He would change his designs many times. 
[16:16.94]This would make each project take a great deal of time 
[16:19.98]and cost more money. 
[16:21.93]The majority of the projects he designed were never built. 
[16:26.21]Also, he did not like to compromise his design ideas 
[16:29.81]to satisfy a buyer's wishes. 
[16:32.54]For this reason and others, 
[16:33.99]Kahn did not make many buildings. 
[16:36.72]His design company did not always have many jobs or much money. 
[16:40.90]In fact, when Kahn died, he was in great debt. 
[16:45.04]This is especially unusual 
[16:46.52]since he was considered one of the most important architects 
[16:49.84]in the world.
[16:52.59]Questions 30 to 32 are based on the passage 
[16:55.98]you have just heard.
[16:58.61]30. Which is one of the defining qualities 
[17:02.77]of Kahn's architecture?
[17:18.45]31. According to the speaker, 
[17:22.35]what has influenced Kahn's work greatly?
[17:39.78]32. Why does the speaker say Khan is not a good businessman?
[17:59.23]Passage Three
[18:01.02]Millions of people depend on the snow 
[18:02.92]in North America's Rocky Mountains for water. 
[18:05.72]But a new report says the amount of snow 
[18:08.13]that stays on the ground there each spring has shrunk 
[18:11.12]over the past 800 years. 
[18:13.16]The report says one cause of the thinning snow pack 
[18:16.36]may be climate change, the warming of Earth's atmosphere. 
[18:20.48]Gregory Pederson was a leader of the study. 
[18:23.48]He notes that during warmer weather, 
[18:25.38]the northern Rocky Mountains usually receive rain instead of snow. 
[18:29.71]The rain does not stay. 
[18:31.34]And whatever snow that falls melts faster than normal. 
[18:34.85]Much research on the subject has been reported 
[18:37.72]during the past ten years. 
[18:39.67]Mr. Pederson says those studies identified human activity 
[18:43.36]as the cause of some of the changes in the permanent snow. 
[18:46.97]He says his team's findings 
[18:48.75]support the results of the earlier studies. 
[18:51.62]The news of reduced snow in the Rockies 
[18:54.08]may surprise people who live there. 
[18:56.30]Record-size snow pack and heavy flooding 
[18:59.45]have affected the area recently. 
[19:01.50]But Gregory Pederson says the unusually large snow pack 
[19:04.82]demonstrates only one single weather event. 
[19:07.66]He said the unusual conditions do not represent the climate 
[19:11.34]over hundreds of years. 
[19:12.90]The research team measured tree rings 
[19:14.95]to help learn about the climate over time. 
[19:17.77]Trees form these rings, or circles of new growth, each year. 
[19:22.17]The circles develop between the bark, or outside skin, 
[19:25.51]of the tree and its core, or center. 
[19:28.17]Mr. Pederson says tree rings can tell about moisture 
[19:31.14]and cloud conditions. 
[19:32.87]They also can provide climate information, 
[19:35.24]including temperatures and the flow of waterways. 
[19:38.34]In some cases, tree rings can show tree injuries from snow slides.
[19:44.09]Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage 
[19:47.98]you have just heard.
[19:51.42]33. What is found according to a new report?
[20:10.17]34. Why are people living in Rocky Mountains 
[20:14.33]surprised by the findings?
[20:31.19]35. What does the speaker say about tree rings?
[20:49.92]Section C
[20:51.51]Directions: In this section, 
[20:54.05]you will hear a passage three times. 
[20:56.46]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[20:59.13]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[21:02.21]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[21:04.99]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[21:07.06]numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words 
[21:11.02]you have just heard. 
[21:12.67]For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 
[21:15.91]you are required to fill in the missing information. 
[21:19.95]For these blanks, 
[21:20.98]you can either use the exact words you have just heard 
[21:23.99]or write down the main points in your own words. 
[21:27.65]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[21:30.82]you should check what you have written.
[21:33.99]Now listen to the passage.
[21:39.45]Getting paid for going to work may sound too good to be true, 
[21:43.69]but it's part of an increasingly popular scheme 
[21:46.43]for employees across Europe. 
[21:48.65]Employers in Belgium, 
[21:50.07]the Netherlands and other European countries are rewarding staff 
[21:53.69]if they come to work on a bicycle, 
[21:55.87]paying them for every kilometer they cycle, 
[21:58.31]all in an effort to promote environmentalism, 
[22:01.43]not to mention a healthier lifestyle. 
[22:03.90]In Belgium, 
[22:04.99]cycling employees are being paid 20 euro cents per kilometer, 
[22:09.20]whereas those in the Netherlands can earn 15 cents 
[22:12.24]and participants in Britain up to 20 pence per mile¡ª
[22:16.53]all of it tax-free. In Belgium, a popular cycling nation, 
[22:21.13]finance ministry figures show that more than 270,000 people 
[22:25.72]took part in the scheme last year, up from 140,000 in 2006. 
[22:32.00]That meant the Belgian tax man paid out 43 million Euros 
[22:35.81]to those who bill for cycling to work. 
[22:38.48]It is believed that 
[22:39.80]higher oil prices and environmental awareness 
[22:42.30]contribute to having more cyclists on the road. 
[22:44.93]One of the most successful corporate proponents 
[22:47.96]has been Belgian discount supermarket chain Colruyt, 
[22:51.13]which launched the policy four years ago 
[22:54.13]and now has 2,100 participants. 
[22:57.19]Colruyt provides employees who live up to 7 km away from work 
[23:02.15]with a bicycle and takes care of maintenance. 
[23:04.97]It is generally believed that 
[23:06.56]employees who cycle to work are healthier 
[23:08.97]than their colleagues who don't. 
[23:10.63]Company spokesman said that apart from employees being healthier 
[23:14.82]there were also other advantages. 
[23:17.19]The more people cycle to work 
[23:18.90]the fewer parking spaces the company has to offer. 
[23:22.27]It's not so easy, especially in urban areas, 
[23:25.12]to expand parking spaces.
[23:28.88]Now the passage will be read again.
[23:33.40]Getting paid for going to work may sound too good to be true, 
[23:37.10]but it's part of an increasingly popular scheme 
[23:40.21]for employees across Europe. 
[23:42.36]Employers in Belgium, 
[23:44.02]the Netherlands and other European countries are rewarding staff 
[23:47.83]if they come to work on a bicycle, 
[23:50.41]paying them for every kilometer they cycle, 
[23:53.23]all in an effort to promote environmentalism, 
[23:56.48]not to mention a healthier lifestyle. 
[23:59.41]In Belgium, 
[24:01.62]cycling employees are being paid 20 euro cents per kilometer, 
[24:05.74]whereas those in the Netherlands can earn 15 cents 
[24:09.39]and participants in Britain up to 20 pence per mile¡ª
[24:13.26]all of it tax-free. In Belgium, a popular cycling nation, 
[24:18.33]finance ministry figures show that more than 270,000 people 
[24:23.71]took part in the scheme last year, up from 140,000 in 2006. 
[24:30.40]That meant the Belgian tax man paid out 43 million Euros 
[24:34.43]to those who bill for cycling to work. 
[24:37.15]It is believed that 
[24:39.16]higher oil prices and environmental awareness 
[24:41.93]contribute to having more cyclists on the road. 
[25:44.66]One of the most successful corporate proponents 
[25:47.17]has been Belgian discount supermarket chain Colruyt, 
[25:50.86]which launched the policy four years ago 
[25:53.49]and now has 2,100 participants. 
[25:57.59]Colruyt provides employees who live up to 7 km away from work 
[26:01.41]with a bicycle and takes care of maintenance. 
[26:04.84]It is generally believed that 
[26:06.24]employees who cycle to work are healthier 
[26:08.50]than their colleagues who don't. 
[27:09.86]Company spokesman said that apart from employees being healthier 
[27:13.10]there were also other advantages. 
[27:15.64]The more people cycle to work 
[27:17.61]the fewer parking spaces the company has to offer. 
[28:20.38]It's not so easy, especially in urban areas, 
[28:23.32]to expand parking spaces.
[28:27.16]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[28:31.66]Getting paid for going to work may sound too good to be true, 
[28:35.78]but it's part of an increasingly popular scheme 
[28:38.69]for employees across Europe. 
[28:40.69]Employers in Belgium, 
[28:42.21]the Netherlands and other European countries are rewarding staff 
[28:46.05]if they come to work on a bicycle, 
[28:48.14]paying them for every kilometer they cycle, 
[28:50.64]all in an effort to promote environmentalism, 
[28:53.74]not to mention a healthier lifestyle. 
[28:56.00]In Belgium, 
[28:57.28]cycling employees are being paid 20 euro cents per kilometer, 
[29:01.61]whereas those in the Netherlands can earn 15 cents 
[29:04.38]and participants in Britain up to 20 pence per mile¡ª
