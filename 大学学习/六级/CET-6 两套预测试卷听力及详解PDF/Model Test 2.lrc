[00:11.32]Part III Listening Comprehension
[00:14.77]Section A
[00:16.50]Directions: In this section,
[00:19.55]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:21.85]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:24.68]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:26.84]one or more questions will be asked about what was said£®
[00:30.35]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:33.33]will be spoken only once. 
[00:35.74]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:39.02]During the pause, you must read the four choices 
[00:42.33]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:45.69]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:48.56]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 
[00:52.63]with a single line through the centre.
[00:55.61]Now let's begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:01.32]11. M: Since you have visited so many countries, 
[01:06.37]you must be able to speak several different languages.
[01:09.78]W: I wish I could, 
[01:11.27]but French and German are the only foreign languages 
[01:14.13]I have ever learned to speak.
[01:16.10]Q: What does the woman imply?
[01:32.35]12. W: How would you like your haircut, Sir?
[01:36.21]M: Please cut the sides shorter, 
[01:38.35]but not so much at the back. 
[01:40.40]Since it's such a hot weather, 
[01:42.50]please thin out the top, but only a little, 
[01:45.57]and leave the front as it is now. 
[01:47.53]Q: How does the man want to have his hair cut?
[02:05.58]13. M: In U.K., 
[02:08.35]are the wedding ceremony and reception held in the same place?
[02:12.59]W: No, not usually. Most people are married in a church, 
[02:17.07]and then the wedding party and guests go to another place 
[02:20.10]for the reception. Sometimes, however, 
[02:23.04]they hold the reception in a big room in the church. 
[02:26.08]Q: What do we learn about the wedding reception in U.K.?
[02:44.04]14. M: I'm not in the mood for doing anything on such dog days. 
[02:49.44]Shall we drive to the country for a spin?
[02:52.23]W: Drive for a spin? 
[02:53.73]I haven't been through with my report. 
[02:56.08]I must hand it in next week. 
[02:58.58]Q: What can be inferred from the conversation?
[03:15.96]15. M: Could you please tell me what room Robert Davis is in?
[03:21.15]W: Yes, he's in the intensive care unit on the third floor. 
[03:25.27]But I suggest you check with the nurses' station 
[03:28.28]before you go in. 
[03:29.90]Q: What does the woman suggest the man do first?
[03:47.50]16. M: A direct flight to London will cost 13 hours. 
[03:52.84]But if you take an indirect one, which is much cheaper, 
[03:56.35]you'll have a 3-hour short stay in Dubai.
[03:59.77]W: That's all right. I don't mind having the time in Dubai. 
[04:03.07]I still have a few things to shop for. 
[04:05.74]Q: What can be inferred from the conversation?
[04:23.24]17. W: My God, what a downpour! 
[04:27.27]And there doesn't seem to be any sign of its stopping. 
[04:30.74]M: I think it will let up in a little while. 
[04:33.18]A downpour like this never lasts long here at this time of year.
[04:37.92]Q: What does the man imply?
[04:54.46]18. W: Are you thinking about further study, 
[04:58.32]or are you planning to go straight into a job?
[05:01.16]M: I'm not sure whether university courses really prepare me 
[05:04.17]for any particular job. 
[05:06.43]They're too academic, not really very practical. 
[05:09.79]Q: How does the man think of further study in university?
[05:28.62]Now you'll hear the two long conversations.
[05:32.58]Conversation One
[05:34.45]W: The Longevity Project is an eye-opening book 
[05:37.85]based on a study which follows 1,500 people over eight decades. 
[05:43.26]This book changes everything we thought about 
[05:45.79]how to live a long and productive life. 
[05:48.48]We're joined now by the author Howard Friedman. 
[05:51.69]First of all, tell us a bit about the study£®
[05:54.79]M: Well, this is really a breakthrough study, 
[05:57.78]because it's the first scientific study 
[06:00.03]that followed people from when they were children¡ª
[06:02.45]back in 1921¡ªthroughout their whole lives£®
[06:06.05]W: So as for that body of information, 
[06:08.73]which is really impressive, 
[06:10.23]is there a best indicator 
[06:12.48]that really stood out why people live long?
[06:15.23]M: The most consistent predictor was actually conscientiousness. 
[06:19.14]A conscientious person is someone who is persistent, 
[06:22.33]organized and cautious. 
[06:24.25]When they start something, they stick to it. 
[06:26.70]W: That sounds like he's a boring person£®
[06:29.51]M: No, no. People with those qualities 
[06:31.87]tend to have more opportunities. 
[06:33.98]They have opportunities to do really cool, fun stuff. 
[06:37.80]W: All right, well, let's have a little "True and False" here, 
[06:41.86]because that will help us get a clearer picture. 
[06:44.58]Carefree folks live longer than anxious people. 
[06:47.63]What do you think?
[06:49.15]M: I think it's a little good to worry. 
[06:51.15]We found those who were committed to their careers, worked hard, 
[06:55.22]stayed involved and succeeded in their careers 
[06:57.81]actually stayed healthier and lived longer£®
[07:00.83]W: All right. Another question is gardening and walking 
[07:04.41]is better for your health than vigorous exercise. 
[07:07.53]Is that right?
[07:08.77]M: True, in a sense. 
[07:10.92]We're certainly not saying that if you love vigorous exercise, 
[07:15.00]you need to stop that. 
[07:16.84]What we recommend is that people find something that they enjoy, 
[07:20.28]gardening, hiking, tennis or wood working, whatever it is, 
[07:25.53]that's the thing you are able to do consistently.
[07:30.00]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the conversation 
[07:33.81]you have just heard.
[07:36.50]19. What do we learn about the study?
[07:55.11]20. What kind of person is most likely to live long?
[08:14.97]21. What does the man suggest when talking about life?
[08:34.21]22. What does the man suggest people do?
[08:53.34]Conversation Two
[08:55.29]M: Jennifer, I'm really enjoying all your art, 
[08:58.18]and I'd like to ask you some questions about this one in particular: 
[09:02.44]Franklin's Fear. 
[09:03.71]Can you tell me how you came up with the idea for this painting?
[09:07.28]W: Alright, this one came up with a few sketches 
[09:10.50]I did on just a very tiny piece of paper, 
[09:13.59]and roughly an idea of what I wanted to do. 
[09:16.74]I want to play with the sky, the color, 
[09:19.16]especially playing with contrast color. 
[09:21.86]They can really catch your attention£®
[09:24.68]M: I love the contrast between these blue mountains 
[09:27.34]and this really yellow sky. It's fantastic. 
[09:30.72]Where do you get the idea to make blue mountains?
[09:33.80]W: I don't know. You just go with the feeling. 
[09:36.94]Sometimes you put a lot of color on there. 
[09:39.76]It looks nice and just goes there by itself, 
[09:42.77]so it's beautiful really£®
[09:44.85]M: And this kind of building at the front 
[09:47.20]is really interesting with these four towers. 
[09:49.84]Is that from your memory?
[09:51.43]W: Right, this one is from an album from Pink Floyd 
[09:55.25]because when I painted I constantly listened to music. 
[09:59.24]Pink Floyd is one of my favorite groups, 
[10:01.52]so I had the idea to put something real 
[10:03.76]in this surrealistic painting, 
[10:05.77]and I thought of the building itself£®
[10:08.06]M: Does this building exist?
[10:09.85]W: Yeah, it's in London. I actually saw it once from the train. 
[10:14.18]I loved it. I almost jumped out the window£®
[10:17.12]M: So then the title, Franklin's Fear, 
[10:20.01]how did you come up with that title?
[10:22.16]W: It just struck me that Benjamin Franklin was famous as a scientist, 
[10:26.79]and he also worked on this advice 
[10:29.09]to protect the houses from lightning. 
[10:31.48]That's where the name is from. 
[10:34.96]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the conversation 
[10:39.09]you have just heard.
[10:42.52]23. What is impressive about the painting?
[11:01.55]24. What do we learn about the building in the painting?
[11:21.08]25. What does Franklin's fear mean according to the conversation?
[11:41.41]Section B
[11:42.95]Directions: In this section, 
[11:45.07]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:47.58]At the end of each passage, 
[11:49.22]you will hear some questions. 
[11:51.18]Both the passage and the questions 
[11:53.14]will be spoken only once. 
[11:55.37]After you hear a question, 
[11:57.08]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[12:00.07]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[12:03.23]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 
[12:07.16]with a single line through the centre.
[12:10.33]Passage One
[12:12.44]Europe's deadly outbreak of a rare form of bacteria 
[12:16.21]has brought new attention to food safety issues. 
[12:19.16]One of the problems when people get sick from food is that 
[12:22.67]it is often difficult to know 
[12:24.36]what on earth the people eat which makes them sick£®
[12:27.81]Of course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries 
[12:31.08]is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. 
[12:34.90]This is easier said than done, 
[12:37.11]but scientists keep looking for new ways£®
[12:39.83]Scientists in the United States have developed an experimental system 
[12:44.15]that uses a high-tech optical scanner. 
[12:47.59]The inspection system is meant for packing houses 
[12:50.41]where produce is sorted for market£®
[12:52.83]The system is designed to identify the presence of pollutants 
[12:56.70]like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. 
[13:00.15]The new scanner can also show damage and imperfections 
[13:03.61]that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers£®
[13:07.07]Scientists who designed the system 
[13:09.55]started with the apple as the model sample. 
[13:12.33]The scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt 
[13:16.99]that moves the produce along. 
[13:19.22]As the apples move along the belt, 
[13:21.27]the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit£®
[13:24.86]The system is equipped with a lamp which can show pollutants 
[13:28.47]and a lamp that produces light 
[13:30.43]which can be used to bounce off an apple to show evidence of damage. 
[13:34.85]The scanner can direct a sorting machine 
[13:37.46]to separate the bad apples from the good ones. 
[13:40.38]The system is currently able to show the surface 
[13:43.34]of only half the apple as it speeds by. 
[13:47.04]The inventers hope to improve the process 
[13:49.67]so it can show the whole surface.
[13:53.75]Questions 26 to 29 are based on the passage 
[13:57.31]you have just heard.
[14:00.63]26. What is the fundamental use of the system?
[14:19.79]27. Where is the system designed to be used?
[14:39.07]28. How does the system work to detect the damage of an apple?
[14:58.84]29. What improvements do researchers hope to make in future?
[15:18.88]Passage Two
[15:20.93]Working from home can be a great benefit, 
[15:23.73]especially for working parents who constantly struggle 
[15:26.92]between the competing demands of family and work life. 
[15:30.61]It means moms and dads can be home 
[15:33.30]when kids walk in the door from school 
[15:35.28]or need a quick ride to a game or practice. 
[15:38.59]Telecommuting also eliminates the time 
[15:40.93]it takes to drive or otherwise commute to the office, 
[15:44.04]freeing up more time for work and helping to boost productivity. 
[15:48.55]But it isn't for everyone, 
[15:50.23]and employers need to make decisions about 
[15:52.51]whom they choose to let work from home. 
[15:55.00]After all, the amount of work done won't increase 
[15:58.04]if workers are more focused on computer games or chatting online all day. 
[16:02.32]Workers who want to work from home should ask themselves 
[16:04.79]whether they can maintain discipline. 
[16:07.09]It's very easy when they are working at home to get pulled away 
[16:10.64]and they end up cleaning the refrigerator instead of working at the desk. 
[16:14.22]They may also have to prove to managers 
[16:17.22]that they can get the job done without being in the office. 
[16:21.07]That's accomplished by providing a detailed plan 
[16:24.08]that notes which projects are to be completed and when. 
[16:27.72]You might also be a good candidate for telecommuting 
[16:31.40]if you possess a unique skill or talent 
[16:33.94]but don't want to move to the city where the employer is located. 
[16:38.36]Software engineers, for example, 
[16:40.60]may find they can negotiate themselves a handsome salary package 
[16:44.61]and not have to endure the expense or the trouble of relocating£®
[16:49.13]However, working from home does have its tradeoffs, 
[16:52.73]including less socialization with co-workers 
[16:55.31]and a diminished sense of teamwork. 
[16:59.26]Questions 30 to 32 are based on the passage 
[17:02.74]you have just heard.
[17:05.97]30. Who benefits most from working at home according to the passage?
[17:25.67]31. What problem may employees have when they work at home?
[17:45.54]32. What is the tradeoff of working at home?
[18:04.55]Passage Three
[18:06.27]Tom Hanks, at 54, 
[18:08.20]has one of the most successful and extensive careers in Hollywood. 
[18:12.28]He has acted in television shows and movies, 
[18:15.05]and done voice work for animated films. 
[18:17.83]He is also a movie director, producer and writer. 
[18:21.29]He currently is part of the leadership 
[18:23.47]of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
[18:26.83]For some time he was the Academy's Vice President. 
[18:30.74]He won the Academy Award for best actor in back to back years. 
[18:35.29]Spencer Tracy is the only other actor to have done that£®
[18:39.39]Tom Hanks was born in California in 1956. 
[18:43.33]His father and mother ended their marriage when he was five. 
[18:47.13]Tom and his elder brother and sister lived with their father. 
[18:51.42]The youngest child stayed with his mother£®
[18:53.83]Tom's family moved a lot and his parents re-married. 
[18:57.60]He once told a reporter that he had had three mothers, four fathers, 
[19:02.09]five schools and ten houses while growing up. 
[19:05.89]The movie star said he thinks the many changes 
[19:08.50]helped him develop a sense of independence£®
[19:11.43]Tom Hanks started acting in high school. 
[19:14.18]He took drama classes in college 
[19:16.40]but left before completing his studies. 
[19:18.93]He has said he could not get parts in college plays 
[19:22.23]so he left to follow his professional dream. 
[19:25.24]He moved to New York City£®
[19:27.64]Tom Hanks mainly worked in comedies in the early years of his career. 
[19:32.32]His starring part in the 1993 movie Philadelphia changed his image. 
[19:38.29]He played a lawyer who launches a case against his law office 
[19:42.01]after it dismisses him because he has AIDS. 
[19:44.68]The star was honored with his first Best Actor Oscar 
[19:48.68]for his work in Philadelphia.
[19:51.13]Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage 
[19:56.19]you have just heard.
[19:59.51]33. What do we learn about Tom Hanks?
[20:17.92]34. How does Tom Hanks think of the many changes of his family?
[20:38.23]35. Why did Tom Hanks leave college before completing studies?
[20:58.22]Section C
[20:59.61]Directions: In this section, 
[21:02.18]you will hear a passage three times. 
[21:04.93]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[21:07.24]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[21:10.57]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[21:13.28]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[21:15.41]numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words 
[21:19.22]you have just heard. 
[21:21.28]For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 
[21:24.31]you are required to fill in the missing information. 
[21:27.81]For these blanks, 
[21:28.97]you can either use the exact words you have just heard 
[21:32.27]or write down the main points in your own words. 
[21:35.64]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[21:39.07]you should check what you have written.
[21:41.65]Now listen to the passage.
[21:45.13]You've probably heard about sports coaches, fitness coaches, 
[21:48.67]music teachers, career counselors and other specialists 
[21:51.99]who teach skills and help us cope with daily life.
[21:55.66]But there's a rapidly growing kind of professional 
[21:58.64]who does a little bit of everything. 
[22:00.61]She or he is called a "life coach". 
[22:03.06]People who are at crossroads in their lives, 
[22:05.51]or corporations that want to give certain employees a career boost, 
[22:09.77]are turning to them for help.
[22:11.85]The idea that one person's success story can change other people's lives 
[22:16.31]for the better goes back at least to the 1930s and best-selling books 
[22:21.00]with titles such as Think and Grow Rich. 
[22:24.32]Dale Carnegie's famous self-improvement program 
[22:27.44]"How to Win Friends and Influence People" came along soon thereafter.
[22:32.65]But this new breed of life coaches 
[22:35.05]includes more than enthusiastic speakers or writers. 
[22:38.72]They use their own experiences in business, sports, 
[22:42.55]or military service to help others make critical life decisions. 
[22:47.18]They often give their approach a slogan, 
[22:49.79]such as "energy coaching" or "fearless living" 
[22:53.48]or "working yourself happy".
[22:56.18]Dave Lakhani in Boise, Idaho, for instance, 
[23:00.05]works with salespeople to develop what he calls a "road map". 
[23:04.09]He says a continuing relationship with a coach 
[23:07.31]is like having a personal fitness trainer 
[23:09.56]for one's career and life outside work. 
[23:12.43]His coaching firm also donates its time to help people 
[23:16.18]who are anything but successful, 
[23:18.49]including unfortunate women and struggling single mothers.
[23:22.40]But others are not thrilled about the life-coaching movement. 
[23:26.30]They say that anyone, trained or untrained, 
[23:29.24]can call himself or herself a life coach, 
[23:32.49]and people messing with others' lives can do more harm than good. 
[23:38.33]Now the passage will be read again.
[23:41.50]You've probably heard about sports coaches, fitness coaches, 
[23:46.11]music teachers, career counselors and other specialists 
[23:49.90]who teach skills and help us cope with daily life.
[23:53.24]But there's a rapidly growing kind of professional 
[23:56.67]who does a little bit of everything. 
[23:58.87]She or he is called a "life coach". 
[24:01.90]People who are at crossroads in their lives, 
[24:04.60]or corporations that want to give certain employees a career boost, 
[24:08.46]are turning to them for help.
[24:11.45]The idea that one person's success story can change other people's lives 
[24:15.74]for the better goes back at least to the 1930s and best-selling books 
[24:20.03]with titles such as Think and Grow Rich. 
[24:23.91]Dale Carnegie's famous self-improvement program

[28:27.61]and people messing with others' lives can do more harm than good. 
[28:33.10]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[28:37.25]You've probably heard about sports coaches, fitness coaches, 
[28:40.82]music teachers, career counselors and other specialists 
[28:44.19]who teach skills and help us cope with daily life.
[28:47.67]But there's a rapidly growing kind of professional 
[28:50.80]who does a little bit of everything. 
[28:52.90]She or he is called a "life coach". 
[28:55.29]People who are at crossroads in their lives, 
[28:57.69]or corporations that want to give certain employees a career boost, 
[29:01.80]are turning to them for help.
[29:04.17]The idea that one person's success story can change other people's lives 
[29:08.47]for the better goes back at least to the 1930s and best-selling books 
[29:13.14]with titles such as Think and Grow Rich. 
[29:16.46]Dale Carnegie's famous self-improvement program 
[29:19.71]"How to Win Friends and Influence People" came along soon thereafter.
[29:25.02]But this new breed of life coaches 
[29:27.21]includes more than enthusiastic speakers or writers. 
[29:30.97]They use their own experiences in business, sports, 
[29:34.54]or military service to help others make critical life decisions. 
[29:39.38]They often give their approach a slogan, 
[29:41.93]such as "energy coaching" or "fearless living" 
[29:45.67]or "working yourself happy".
[29:48.76]Dave Lakhani in Boise, Idaho, for instance, 
[29:52.35]works with salespeople to develop what he calls a "road map". 
[29:56.58]He says a continuing relationship with a coach 
[29:59.41]is like having a personal fitness trainer 
[30:01.84]for one's career and life outside work. 
[30:04.48]His coaching firm also donates its time to help people 
[30:08.40]who are anything but successful, 
[30:10.63]including unfortunate women and struggling single mothers.
[30:14.66]But others are not thrilled about the life-coaching movement. 
[30:18.60]They say that anyone, trained or untrained, 
[30:21.59]can call himself or herself a life coach, 
[30:24.75]and people messing with others' lives can do more harm than good. 
[30:30.50]This is the end of listening comprehension.
