[00:07.98]Test Seven
[00:09.34]Part III   Listening Comprehension 
[00:12.31]Section A
[00:13.41]Directions: In this section, 
[00:15.75]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:18.25]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:20.74]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:22.57]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:24.97]about what was said. 
[00:26.43]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:29.07]will be spoken only once. 
[00:30.97]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:34.21]During the pause, you must read the four 
[00:37.14]choices marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:41.64]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:44.52]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:46.85]on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line 
[00:50.21]through the centre.
[00:51.89]Now let¡¯s begin with the 8 short conversations.
[00:57.20]11. W: This apartment consists of two bedrooms, 
[01:01.80]a living room with a satellite TV, 
[01:04.38]a completely equipped kitchen and a great bathroom. 
[01:08.60]And the charge is quite reasonable, you know.
[01:11.72]M: Yes, that¡¯s right. 
[01:13.15]But if it¡¯s located on the other side of town, 
[01:16.48]we¡¯ll definitely buy it. 
[01:18.44]Q: What does the man think of the apartment?
[01:37.54]12. W: I¡¯m sorry, Mike. 
[01:40.54]I have to put off our meeting till four o¡¯clock this afternoon.   
[01:44.66]Mr. Anderson wants me to revise the annual report right now.
[01:48.98]M: Take your time. My schedule is flexible.
[01:52.73]Q: What does the man mean?
[02:11.07]13. M: Have you noticed John¡¯s great progress 
[02:15.27]he has made in his studies? 
[02:17.15]He studies quite hard now. 
[02:19.25]What¡¯s more, he seems to take a liking to the studies.
[02:22.85]W: Yeah, you can say that again. 
[02:25.40]He is not what he used to be.
[02:27.76]Q: What can we infer from the conversation?
[02:47.21]14. M: Jane, could you do me a favor, please? 
[02:51.48]I am in a hurry to get to the airport before 4. 
[02:55.01]Can I borrow you car?
[02:57.32]W: I wish I could, 
[02:58.61]but I don¡¯t even have a garage.
[03:02.25]Q: What does the woman mean?
[03:20.80]15. W: You look good today. 
[03:23.65]What¡¯s the big news?
[03:25.42]M: Well, you know, 
[03:26.55]I have failed several times in the driving test, 
[03:29.59]but I finally got my luck last week.
[03:32.79]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[03:51.61]16. W: Michael, have you seen the new Hollywood movie, 
[03:56.85]Hannah Montana, The Movie£¿
[03:58.95]It is great. I love the story, especially the music; 
[04:03.43]that¡¯s my favorite part.
[04:05.29]M: Well, it is really not my cup of tea.
[04:09.04]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[04:29.08]17. W: Well, you handed in your paper last week, 
[04:33.16]but I found that it was exactly the same as William¡¯s. 
[04:36.87]Can you explain this to me, please?
[04:39.28]M: I¡¯m sorry; I won¡¯t do it again.
[04:42.46]Q: What¡¯s the probable relationship between the two speakers?
[05:02.57]18. M: I¡¯m wondering if I could possibly schedule an appointment 
[05:07.78]with Mr. Kelly this week.
[05:10.18]W: Let me see. On Monday, 
[05:12.70]he will be in Paris for a meeting, 
[05:14.83]and it will take him three days there; 
[05:17.26]then he will fly to London to meet an important client¡­
[05:21.00]Well, I don¡¯t think he is available this week.
[05:24.85]Q: What can be inferred from the conversation?
[05:45.20]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[05:48.17]Conversation One
[05:50.04]W: You are an expert on urban problem, Mr. Cross. 
[05:53.72]I wonder how you would describe 
[05:55.67]the characteristics of these enormous cities.
[05:58.68]M: The first point to make is that they are 
[06:01.90]different from large cities in Europe and America.
[06:05.39]W: Surly all large cities are essentially similar.
[06:09.44]M: It¡¯s true that all large cities experience 
[06:13.33]similar problems provisioning housing and services, 
[06:17.95]but the difference lies in the time factor.
[06:21.54]W: Surly some of the cities we are considering 
[06:24.31]are just as old and, in some cases, much older, 
[06:29.01]than cities in the United States, for instance.
[06:32.20]M: Very true, but the large cities of Europe 
[06:35.91]and the United States grew relatively slowly. 
[06:40.13]London had a population of more than a million 
[06:43.88]at the beginning of the nineteenth century 
[06:46.96]and this number of more than eight million. 
[06:50.19]And this growth was parallel to industrial growth 
[06:54.05]throughout the country. 
[06:55.85]The same is true of New York, for example.
[06:59.41]W: But this is not true of Mexico city 
[07:02.74]or Buenos Aires?
[07:04.47]M: No, it is not. Throughout Latin America 
[07:08.53]and in parts of Asia, cities have grown 
[07:11.12]much faster than industry, or agriculture 
[07:14.47]for that matter. Some of these cities 
[07:17.08]have quadrupled in size in less than two decades, 
[07:21.08]while industrial growth over the same period 
[07:24.14]may have only reached thirty to forty percent.
[07:27.86]W: What does this mean?
[07:30.25]M: Essentially the population growth is not 
[07:33.24]equal to the number of employment opportunities. 
[07:36.65]Much of the increase is due to immigration 
[07:39.91]from the countryside, a movement of people 
[07:42.91]in search of better conditions.
[07:46.29]Questions 19 to 21 are based 
[07:49.31]on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:52.57]19. What is the relationship between 
[07:55.54]the two speakers? 
[08:12.47]20. In which period did the population of London 
[08:16.05]reach about 1 million? 
[08:33.58]21. Where have many large cities sprung up so quickly?
[08:52.67]Conversation Two
[08:54.27]W: Hmm, Hi.
[08:57.01]M: Hi. I¡¯m going door to door tonight to tell 
[09:00.85]people about the student action coalition. 
[09:04.16]Do you have a few minutes?
[09:05.66]W: Sure. You know I think I read something 
[09:08.68]in the newspaper last week.
[09:10.62]M: Yeah. There was an article about this 
[09:13.00]in the last issue. See, we¡¯re trying to 
[09:16.11]protect and conserve some of the open spaces 
[09:19.22]on campus.
[09:20.53]W: That¡¯s right. You are the group that¡¯s 
[09:22.83]opposing the extension of the parking lot 
[09:25.35]next to Swing Hall, right?
[09:27.40]M: That¡¯s us. We must feel 
[09:29.65]that it¡¯s important to save some of 
[09:32.30]the natural beauty of the campus, like 
[09:34.82]over by Swing.Some of those trees 
[09:38.39]are hundreds of years old.
[09:40.18]W: It is a pretty spot. My friends and I 
[09:43.37]have had picnics over there by the creek.
[09:46.00]M: Then you understand how we feel. 
[09:48.89]We¡¯re organizing a rally on Thursday afternoon 
[09:52.16]to get the administration to reconsider 
[09:54.34]the parking lot plan.
[09:56.39]W: Well, I have a class on Thursday afternoon.
[10:00.37]M: But maybe you could sign this petition? 
[10:03.60]We¡¯re going to submit it to the 
[10:05.74]administration to demonstrate how 
[10:07.93]the students feel about this.
[10:10.15]W: Sure, let me get a pen and I¡¯ll sign it.
[10:13.87]M: I have a pen right here. 
[10:16.33]And let me leave you this pamphlet 
[10:18.74]about the student action coalition. 
[10:21.25]Maybe you could come to some of our meetings. 
[10:24.12]We get together once a month.
[10:26.27]W: Yeah. I¡¯d like to know more about your group. 
[10:29.21]Let me know when the next meeting is 
[10:31.65]and I¡¯ll try to be there. 
[10:33.31]Questions 22 to 25 are based 
[10:36.36]on the conversation you have just heard. 
[10:39.71]22. How did the woman first learn 
[10:42.69]about the student action coalition? 
[11:00.55]23. What is the student action coalition 
[11:04.02]trying to do? 
[11:20.54]24. What will the woman probably do 
[11:23.56]on Thursday afternoon? 
[11:40.44]25. What does the woman agree to do? 
[11:59.21]Section B
[12:00.50]Directions: In this section, 
[12:02.69]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[12:05.37]At the end of each passage, 
[12:07.28]you will hear some questions. 
[12:09.36]Both the passage and the questions 
[12:11.49]will be spoken only once. 
[12:13.66]After you hear a question, you must choose 
[12:16.63]the best answer from the four choices 
[12:19.24]marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:23.31]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 
[12:26.97]with a single line through the centre.
[12:30.28]Passage One
[12:33.10]People often miss meals 
[12:34.68]because they get busy or are trying to lose weight. 
[12:38.04]But how you skip meals, 
[12:39.85]and the amount you eat at your next meal, 
[12:42.21]can affect your overall health.
[12:44.54]In recent months, 
[12:46.14]two new studies may help explain 
[12:48.49]how skipping meals affects health.
[12:50.78]The more recent study looked at 
[12:53.51]what happens when people skip meals 
[12:55.75]but end up eating just as much as they would in a normal day 
[12:59.28]when they finally do sit down to a meal. 
[13:02.30]The study, conducted by diabetes researchers, 
[13:05.86]involved healthy, normal-weight men and women in their 40s. 
[13:09.81]For two months, 
[13:11.09]the study subjects ate three meals a day. 
[13:13.56]For another eight-week period, 
[13:15.94]they skipped two meals 
[13:17.65]but ate the same number of calories in one evening meal, 
[13:20.97]consumed between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.
[13:23.94]The researchers found that skipping meals 
[13:27.02]during the day and eating one large meal in the evening 
[13:30.53]resulted in potentially risky metabolic changes. 
[13:34.22]If the meal skippers persisted long term, 
[13:37.25]it could lead to diabetes.
[13:39.49]The study was notable 
[13:41.56]because it followed another study earlier this year 
[13:44.73]that found that skipping meals every other day 
[13:47.57]could actually improve a patient¡¯s health. 
[13:50.55]In that study, overweight adults ate normal meals one day. 
[13:55.26]This was followed by a day of severely restricted eating, 
[13:58.94]when they ate about 400 or 500 calories a day ¡ª 
[14:02.77]the equivalent of about one meal. 
[14:05.18]After following the special dieting pattern for two months, 
[14:08.85]the dieters lost an average of 8 percent of their body weight, 
[14:12.40]and they had lower cholesterol. 
[14:15.06]The conclusion, 
[14:17.05]say the authors of the more recent meal-skipping study, 
[14:20.39]is that skipping meals as part of a controlled eating plan 
[14:23.73]that results in lower calorie intake can result in better health. 
[14:28.26]However, skipping meals during the day 
[14:30.84]and then overeating at the evening meal 
[14:34.11]results in harmful changes in the body.
[14:39.01]Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage 
[14:42.18]you have just heard.
[14:44.53]26. What are the two studies for?
[15:04.43]27. How long did the more recent study last?
[15:24.20]28. What can we know about the dieters 
[15:27.59]in the second-mentioned study?
[15:45.56]Passage Two
[15:47.06]The American government, as well as every 
[15:49.74]American individual, 
[15:51.10]is touched and concerned with inflation, 
[15:53.98]and President Carter 
[15:55.30]has called it our No.1 problem. 
[15:57.52]Indeed, inflation deserves this title.
[16:01.08]The great jump in inflation has been during the past 10 years. 
[16:05.14]Looking at the raw figures, 
[16:06.88]people might consider this a time of prosperity. 
[16:09.93]The wage of the average worker was ¡ç114 a week in 1969, 
[16:16.01]and by September, 1978 
[16:19.02]it had reached ¡ç206. 
[16:21.57]The number grew as much as ¡ç92. 
[16:25.00]On the surface it might seem that people are better off, 
[16:28.56]but it is not true. 
[16:30.40]Taking into consideration the effects 
[16:32.22]of inflation, the picture is different. 
[16:35.16]Actually, inflation plays an important role.
[16:38.80]In 1976 the consumer price index stood at 100 
[16:43.71]and it has now topped 200. 
[16:46.12]Allowing for this, 
[16:47.69]the average wage of workers was ¡ç104 in 1969 
[16:52.82]and ¡ç105 in April 1978. 
[16:57.40]Since then with more inflation any gain in purchasing power 
[17:01.85]has been wiped out and more taken away. 
[17:05.13]In fact during the year of 1978, 
[17:08.52]the buying power of the average paycheck 
[17:10.87]had fallen by 3.4 percent. In addition to 
[17:14.35]the income tax, there are usually state 
[17:17.17]and country taxes, the sales tax, 
[17:20.01]that is added to the cost of an item 
[17:21.82]at the retail level. 
[17:23.50]This is another tax that has been increasing with inflation, 
[17:26.81]and it affects all purchasers£¬including 
[17:29.17]the poorest citizens. Think twice before 
[17:31.91]you say that inflation is not a big deal.
[17:35.89]Questions 29 to 31 are based 
[17:38.81]on the passage you have just heard.
[17:42.95]29. What does the article say about inflation? 
[18:03.16]30. How much will the dollar buy 
[18:05.81]in real goods now compared with 1976? 
[18:25.52]31. What tax is collected from even 
[18:28.61]the poorest citizen? 
[18:46.12]Passage Three
[18:47.79]The African ancestors of today¡¯s black Americans 
[18:51.46]were brought to the U.S. as slaves 
[18:54.38]in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. 
[18:58.71]They worked on farms, especially 
[19:01.60]the large farms in the southern states. 
[19:04.57]Slowly they became a necessary part of 
[19:07.70]the economic system of the South.
[19:10.53]Slaves did not have the rights of people, 
[19:13.50]according to the law, they were ¡°things¡± 
[19:16.22]which belonged to the person who bought them. 
[19:18.85]They had to obey the orders of their owners 
[19:22.32]without question. 
[19:23.95]They were not allowed to learn to read, 
[19:26.44]because their owners feared 
[19:28.36]that educated slaves would begin to think about 
[19:31.73]the injustice of the system and would learn 
[19:34.80]to struggle for their freedom. 
[19:36.94]Slaves had to work long hours in extremely unhealthy conditions. 
[19:42.33]Their owners had complete power over them. 
[19:45.52]They could be bought and sold like animals. 
[19:48.81]At the slave markets, black children 
[19:51.74]were separated from their parents 
[19:54.00]and never saw them again. 
[19:56.08]Slave owners had the right to punish severely any slave 
[20:00.45]who broke rules or protested against the system. 
[20:04.96]Slaves were often beaten brutally by their owners or killed. 
[20:09.52]After the Civil War, one free slave 
[20:13.48]reported that his owners killed an older slave 
[20:16.95]who was teaching him to read.
[20:19.08]There was a law against brutality to slaves, 
[20:23.02]so in theory an owner who treated a slave badly 
[20:27.14]could be punished. 
[20:28.68]In practice, however, 
[20:30.11]the law meant nothing. 
[20:32.14]Another law said that slaves could not give evidence 
[20:35.78]against white people, so very few owners 
[20:38.83]were ever punished for their brutality.
[20:43.84]Questions 32 to 35 are based 
[20:46.69]on the passage you have just heard.
[20:50.23]32. Why couldn¡¯t slaves learn to read? 
[21:11.56]33. What happened to slaves 
[21:14.30]who broke the rules of the system? 
[21:32.91]34. How was the condition of the slaves 
[21:36.26]after the Civil War? 
[21:54.45]35. What can we infer from the passage?
[22:14.18]Section C
[22:15.41]Directions: 
[22:16.93]In this section, 
[22:18.16]you will hear a passage three times, 
[22:21.07]when the passage is read for the first time, 
[22:23.54]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[22:27.26]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[22:29.73]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[22:32.08]numbered from 36 to 43 
[22:35.68]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[22:38.59]For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 
[22:42.23]you are required to fill in the missing information. 
[22:46.23]For these blanks, 
[22:47.39]you can either use the exact words 
[22:49.87]you have just heard 
[22:51.44]or write down the main points in your own words. 
[22:54.64]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[22:58.36]you should check what you have written.
[23:00.66]Now listen to the passage. 
[23:04.25]One of those rare local creations of America, 
[23:08.37]cowboy poetry has a long and vivid history, 
[23:11.86]driven by its colorful practitioners and memorable poems.
[23:16.55]Cowboy poetry is a form of poetry 
[23:19.38]which grew out of a tradition of instant composition 
[23:22.79]carried on by workers on cattle drives and ranches. 
[23:26.41]After a day of work, 
[23:28.10]cowboys would gather around a campfire 
[23:30.74]and entertain one another with tall tales and folk songs. 
[23:34.41]Illiteracy was common, 
[23:36.79]so poetic forms were employed to help memory.
[23:40.05]Cowboy poetry is distinctive 
[23:42.51]both in its culturally specific subject matter 
[23:45.76]and its traditional use of rhyme and meter. 
[23:49.06]While the range of emotional landscapes 
[23:52.26]explored in cowboy poetry 
[23:54.06]are the traditional province of poetry, 
[23:57.02]from joy to grief, 
[23:58.42]from humor to spirituality, 
[24:01.06]the particulars derive  from the American West: 
[24:03.85]horses, cattle, fire, storms, 
[24:06.62]mythic figures of cowboys and ranchers, 
[24:09.48]and the splendid wilderness. 
[24:11.78]In keeping with their subject matter, 
[24:13.94]cowboy poets tend to write in a traditional, rhyming style. 
[24:18.02]They echo folk songs more than modern poetry. 
[24:21.76]Contrary to common belief, 
[24:23.38]cowboy poetry does not actually 
[24:25.88]have to be written by cowboys, 
[24:28.22]though adherents would claim that 
[24:30.90]authors should have some connection to the cowboy life 
[24:33.51]such that they can write poetry 
[24:35.20]with an ¡°insider¡¯s perspective¡±.
[24:38.43]The rise of the cowboy poet coincides 
[24:40.62]with the virtual disappearance from popular culture 
[24:44.07]of another Western figure. 
[24:45.97]Hollywood used to make dozens of films a year 
[24:49.21]about square-jawed gunslingers. 
[24:52.58]It now produces almost none, 
[24:54.94]and there is currently no new Western series 
[24:57.71]to be found on television or basic cable. 
[25:01.03]But the departure of the heroic cowboy 
[25:03.73]has opened some room for gentler, 
[25:05.64]more reflective voices. 
[25:08.24]Although it is growing, 
[25:09.78]their audience is smaller: 
[25:11.68]unlike Western films, 
[25:13.82]cowboy poetry is mostly produced by Westerners, 
[25:17.31]for Westerners.
[25:21.74]Now the passage will be read again.
[25:24.70]One of those rare local creations of America, 
[25:30.17]cowboy poetry has a long and vivid history, 
[25:33.79]driven by its colorful practitioners and memorable poems.
[25:38.01]Cowboy poetry is a form of poetry 
[25:41.20]which grew out of a tradition of instant composition 
[25:44.43]carried on by workers on cattle drives and ranches. 
[25:48.29]After a day of work, 
[25:49.75]cowboys would gather around a campfire 
[25:52.36]and entertain one another with tall tales and folk songs. 
[25:56.78]Illiteracy was common, 
[25:58.57]so poetic forms were employed to help memory.
[26:02.11]Cowboy poetry is distinctive 
[26:04.48]both in its culturally specific subject matter 
[26:07.51]and its traditional use of rhyme and meter. 
[26:10.51]While the range of emotional landscapes 
[26:14.12]explored in cowboy poetry 
[26:15.77]are the traditional province of poetry, 
[26:18.24]from joy to grief, 
[26:19.73]from humor to spirituality, 
[26:22.36]the particulars derive  from the American West: 
[26:25.40]horses, cattle, fire, storms, 
[26:28.29]mythic figures of cowboys and ranchers, 
[26:30.79]and the splendid wilderness. 
[26:33.35]In keeping with their subject matter, 
[26:35.35]cowboy poets tend to write in a traditional, rhyming style. 
[26:39.67]They echo folk songs more than modern poetry. 
[26:43.22]Contrary to common belief, 
[26:44.75]cowboy poetry does not actually 
[26:47.03]have to be written by cowboys, 
[26:49.30]though adherents would claim that 
[26:51.84]authors should have some connection to the cowboy life 
[26:54.92]such that they can write poetry 
[26:56.60]with an ¡°insider¡¯s perspective¡±.
[27:49.38]The rise of the cowboy poet coincides 
[27:51.55]with the virtual disappearance from popular culture 
[27:55.01]of another Western figure. 
[27:57.22]Hollywood used to make dozens of films a year 
[28:00.20]about square-jawed gunslingers. 
[28:03.54]It now produces almost none, 
[28:05.92]and there is currently no new Western series 
[28:08.58]to be found on television or basic cable. 
[29:01.98]But the departure of the heroic cowboy 
[29:04.10]has opened some room for gentler, 
[29:06.35]more reflective voices. 
[29:08.83]Although it is growing, 
[29:10.16]their audience is smaller: 
[29:12.01]unlike Western films, 
[29:14.16]cowboy poetry is mostly produced by Westerners, 
[29:17.72]for Westerners.
