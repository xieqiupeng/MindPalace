[00:09.00]Test One
[00:10.26]Part III  Listening Comprehension
[00:13.77]Section A
[00:15.47]Directions: In this section,
[00:18.93]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:21.50]and 2 long conversations.
[00:23.42]At the end of each conversation,
[00:25.81]one or more questions will be asked about
[00:28.29]what was said. Both the conversation and the questions
[00:32.20]will be spoken only once.
[00:34.01]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:37.30]During the pause, you must read the four choices
[00:41.05]marked A), B), C) and D), and decide
[00:45.66]which is the best answer.
[00:47.39]Then mark the corresponding letter on
[00:50.48]Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.43]Now let's begin with the 8 short conversations.
[00:59.26]11. W: Jim, you are on the net again!
[01:06.76]When are you going to get off? It¡¯s time for the talk show.
[01:10.77]M: Just a minute dear! I¡¯m looking at a new jewelry site.
[01:14.84]I want to make sure I get the right gift for mom¡¯s birthday.
[01:18.28]Q: What is the man doing right now?
[01:35.02]12. W: I have never seen you
[01:40.08]have such confidence before in the exam!
[01:42.51]M: It¡¯s more than confidence!
[01:44.37]Right now I feel that if I get less than an A,
[01:47.38]it will be the fault of the exam itself.
[01:50.20]Q: What does the man mean?
[02:05.76]13. W: Just look at this newspaper!
[02:11.67]Nothing but murder, death and war!
[02:15.14]Do you still believe people are basically good?
[02:18.55]M: Of course, I do! But newspapers
[02:21.37]hardly ever report stories about peace and generosity.
[02:25.35]They are not news!
[02:27.15]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[02:43.90]14. M: Tom must be joking when he said
[02:49.55]he plans to sell his shop and go to medical school.
[02:52.89]W: You are quite right! He¡¯s just kidding!
[02:55.81]He¡¯s also told me time and time again
[02:58.88]he wished to study for some profession
[03:01.57]instead of going into business.
[03:03.63]Q: What will Tom probably do according to the conversation?
[03:20.31]15. W: I hear your boss has a real good impression of you,
[03:28.05]and he is thinking about giving you two more days off each month.
[03:32.17]M: I hope not. I¡¯d rather get more work hours ,
[03:35.80]so I can get enough bucks to help out my two kids at college.
[03:39.41]Q: What does the man truly want?
[03:55.99]16. M: I heard you took a trip to Mexico last month.
[04:02.85]How did you like it?
[04:04.44]W: Oh, I got sick and tired of the hotels
[04:07.77]and hotel food! So now I understand the thing:
[04:11.80]East, west, home¡¯s best!
[04:15.78]Q: What does the woman mean?
[04:31.01]17. W: I¡¯m worried about Anna.
[04:36.35]She¡¯s really been depressed lately.
[04:39.31]All she does is staying in her room all day.
[04:42.43]M: That sounds serious!
[04:44.38]She¡¯d better see a psychiatrist at the counseling center.
[04:48.08]Q: What does the man suggest Anna do?
[05:04.66]18. M: I could hardly recognize Sam 
[05:11.12]after he got that new job!
[05:12.95]He¡¯s always in a suit and tie now.
[05:15.32]W: Yeah. He was never liked that in college.
[05:18.74]Back then, he went around in old T-shirts and jeans.
[05:22.80]Q: What do the speakers say about Sam?
[05:40.05]Now you will hear the two long conversations.
[05:45.16]Conversation One
[05:47.04]M: Hi, Ann! Welcome back! How was your trip to the States?
[05:52.88]W: Very busy. I had a lot of meetings,
[05:56.98]so, of course, I didn¡¯t have much time to see New York.
[06:01.17]M: What a pity! Actually, I have a trip there myself next week.
[06:05.34]W: Do you? Then take my advice, do the well-being
[06:10.32]in the air program. It really works.
[06:13.46]M: Oh, I read about that in a magazine.
[06:15.61]You say it works?
[06:17.14]W: Yes, I did the program on the flight to the States,
[06:20.65]and when I arrived in New York,
[06:22.54]I didn¡¯t have any problem, no jet lag at all.
[06:27.00]On the way back, I didn¡¯t do it, and I felt terrible.
[06:31.94]M: You¡¯re joking!
[06:33.07]W: Not at all, it really made a lot of difference.
[06:36.61]M: En. So what did you do?
[06:39.61]W: Well, I didn¡¯t drink any alcohol or coffee,
[06:43.55]and I didn¡¯t eat any meat or rich food.
[06:46.56]I drink a lot of water, and free juice,
[06:50.07]and I ate the meals on the well-being menu.
[06:53.32]They¡¯re lighter. They have fish, vegetables, and noodles,
[06:58.28]for example, and I did some of the exercises in the program.
[07:02.45]M: Exercises? On a plane?
[07:05.36]W: Yes. I didn¡¯t do many, of course,
[07:08.43]there isn¡¯t much space on a plane.
[07:10.70]M: How many passengers do the exercises?
[07:13.75]W: Not many.
[07:15.00]M: Then how much champagne did they drink?
[07:17.52]W: A lot! It was more popular than mineral water.
[07:21.74]M: So, basically, it's a choice.
[07:23.73]Mineral water and exercises, or champagne and jet lag.
[07:27.90]W: That¡¯s right! It¡¯s a difficult choice.
[07:31.05]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the conversation
[07:37.22]you have just heard.
[07:38.97]19. Why did the woman go to New York?
[07:56.63]20. What does the woman say about the well-being
[08:02.76]in the air program?
[08:17.54]21. What did the woman do to follow the well-being menu?
[08:37.62]22. What did the woman say about other passengers?
[08:57.36]Conversation Two
[09:00.44]W: Morning. Can I help you?
[09:03.89]M: Well, I¡¯ m not really sure.
[09:06.44]I' m just looking.
[09:07.72]W: I see. Well, there¡¯s plenty to look at it again this year.
[09:11.92]I¡¯m sure you have to walk miles to see each stand.
[09:15.62]M: That¡¯s true.
[09:16.63]W: Er..., would you like a coffee?
[09:18.67]Come and sit down for a minute, no obligation.
[09:21.71]M: Well, that¡¯s very kind of you, but...
[09:24.15]W: Now, please. Is this the first year
[09:27.32]you¡¯ve been to the fair,  Mr...
[09:29.23]M: Yes, Johnson, James Johnson.
[09:31.56]W: My name's Susan Carter.
[09:33.49]Are you looking for anything in particular,
[09:35.82]or are you just interested in computers in general?
[09:39.16]M: Well, actually, I have some specific jobs in mind.
[09:42.88]I own a small company, we¡¯ve grown quite dramatically
[09:46.59]over the past 12 months,
[09:48.04]and we really need some technological help 
[09:50.81]to enable us to keep on top of everything.
[09:53.21]W: What¡¯s your line of business, Mr. Johnson?
[09:56.09]M: We¡¯re a training consultancy.
[09:58.30]W: I see. And what do you need ¡°to keep on top¡±?
[10:02.46]M: The first thing is correspondence.
[10:04.88]We have a lot of standard letters and forms.
[10:07.85]So I suppose we need some kind of word processor.
[10:11.12]W: Right. Well, that¡¯s no problem.
[10:14.17]But it may be possible for you to get a system
[10:17.34]that does a lot of other things
[10:19.02]in addition to word processing.
[10:21.05]What might suit you is the MR5000.
[10:25.53]That¡¯s it over there! It¡¯s IBM compatible.
[10:29.05]M: What about the price?
[10:30.87]W: Well, the MR5000 costs 1,050 pounds.
[10:37.24]Software comes free with the hardware.
[10:40.00]M: Well, I¡¯ll think about it. Thank you.
[10:43.79]W: Here¡¯s my card. Please feel free to contact me.
[10:47.40]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the conversation
[10:53.76]you have just heard.
[10:55.55]23. Where did the conversation take place?
[11:15.15]24. What are the speakers talking about?
[11:33.18]25. What is the man¡¯s line of business?
[11:52.27]Section B
[11:55.13]Directions: In this section,
[11:59.94]you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:02.54]At the end of each passage,
[12:04.76]you will hear some questions.
[12:06.39]Both the passage and the questions
[12:08.90]will be spoken only once.
[12:11.02]After you hear a question,
[12:13.10]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[12:16.53]marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:21.05]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2
[12:25.63]with a single line through the centre.
[12:28.07]Passage One
[12:30.42]The new year always brings with the cultural tradition
[12:35.64]of new possibilities.
[12:37.38]We see it as a chance for renewal.
[12:40.24]We begin to dream of new possible selves.
[12:43.96]We design our ideal self or an image
[12:47.94]that is quite different from what we are now.
[12:50.36]For some of us, we roll at dreamy film in our heads
[12:54.86]just because it¡¯s the beginning of a new year.
[12:57.58]But we aren¡¯t serious about making changes.
[13:01.23]We just make some half-hearted resolution
[13:04.24]and it evaporates after a week or two.
[13:07.18]The experience makes us feel less successful
[13:11.02]and leads us to discount our ability
[13:14.02]to change in the future. It¡¯s not the changes impossible
[13:18.80]but that it won¡¯t last unless our resolutions
[13:22.17]are supported with plans for implementation.
[13:25.17]We have to make our intentions manageable
[13:28.59]by detailing the specific steps
[13:30.78]that will carry us to our goal.
[13:32.90]Say your goal is to lose weight by dieting
[13:37.28]and cutting off sweets.
[13:39.40]But one night you just have to have a cookie.
[13:42.94]And you know there¡¯s a bag of your favorites
[13:45.65]in the cupboard. You want one, you eat two,
[13:50.23]you check the bag and find out
[13:52.70]you¡¯ve just shot 132 calories. You say to yourself,
[13:57.53]¡°What the hell!¡± and polish off the whole bag.
[14:01.16]Then you begin to draw all kinds of
[14:04.70]unpleasant conclusions about yourself.
[14:07.79]To protect your sense of self,
[14:10.42]you begin to discount the goal. You may think ¨C
[14:13.97]"Well, dieting wasn¡¯t that important to me
[14:17.37]and I won¡¯t make it anyhow.¡±
[14:19.20]So you abandon the goal and return to your bad habits.
[14:25.22]Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage
[14:30.27]you have just heard.
[14:32.02]26. What do people usually wish to do
[14:38.19]at the beginning of a new year?
[14:52.10]27. How can people turn their new year¡¯s resolutions
[14:59.08]into reality?
[15:13.84]28. Why does the speaker mention
[15:18.78]the example of sweets and cookies?
[15:34.42]Passage Two
[15:37.83]25 years ago, Ray Anderson,
[15:42.16]a single parent with a one-year-old son
[15:45.07]witnessed a terrible accident
[15:47.38]which took place when the driver of a truck
[15:50.16]ran a red light and collided with the car of Sandra Jenins.
[15:54.85]The impact of the collision killed Sandra instantly.
[15:58.27]But her three-month-old daughter
[16:00.75]was left trapped in the burning car.
[16:02.65]While others looked on in horror,
[16:05.10]Andersen jumped out of his vehicle
[16:07.91]and crawled into the car through the shadowed rear window
[16:11.17]to try to free the infant. Seconds later,
[16:15.35]the car was enclosed in flames.
[16:18.05]But to everyone¡¯s amazement,
[16:20.78]Andersen was able to pull the baby to safety.
[16:24.17]While the baby was all right, Andersen
[16:27.15]was seriously injured. Two days later he died.
[16:32.18]But his heroic act was published widely in the media.
[16:36.06]His son was soon adopted by relatives.
[16:39.18]The most remarkable part of the story unfolded only last week.
[16:44.63]Karen and her boyfriend Michael were looking
[16:48.30]through some old boxes
[16:50.18]When they came across some old newspaper clippings.
[16:52.99]¡°This is me when I was a new born baby.
[16:56.01]I was rescued from a burning car.
[16:58.40]But my mother died in the accident,¡± explained Karen.
[17:01.94]Although Michael knew Karen¡¯s mother
[17:04.71]had died years earlier,
[17:06.19]he never fully understood the circumstances
[17:09.08]until he skimmed over the newspaper article.
[17:12.16]To Karen¡¯s surprise,
[17:14.55]Michael was absorbed in the details of the accident.
[17:17.55]And he began to cry uncontrollably.
[17:20.65]Then he revealed that the man that pulled Karen from the flames 
[17:25.61]was the father he never knew.
[17:27.99]The two embraced and shed many tears,
[17:31.24]recounting stories told to them about their parents.
[17:34.95]Questions 29 to 31 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:41.46]29. What happened twenty-five years ago?
[17:59.58]30. What does the speaker say about Michael¡¯s father?
[18:19.33]31. Why did Michael cry uncontrollably
[18:24.90]when he skimmed over the newspaper article?
[18:40.25]Passage Three
[18:42.85]Americans suffer from an overdose of work.
[18:47.87]Regardless of who they are or what they do.
[18:51.56]Americans spend more time at work
[18:54.05]than that any time since World War II.
[18:56.84]In 1950,the US had fewer working hours
[19:01.88]than any other industrialized country.
[19:04.56]Today, it exceeds every country but Japan
[19:07.96]where industrial employees load 2155 hours a year
[19:14.14]compared with 1951 in the US
[19:18.43]and 1603 in the former West Germany.
[19:23.43]Between 1969 and 1989, employed Americans
[19:29.00]add an average of 138 hours to their yearly work schedules.
[19:34.08]The workweek has remained above 40 hours.
[19:37.88]But people are working more weeks each year.
[19:41.13]Specifically pay time off holidays, vacations,
[19:47.06]sick leave shrank by 50% in the 1980s.
[19:51.67]As corporations have experienced stiff competitions 
[19:56.46]and slow in growth of productivity,
[19:58.60]they have pressed employees to work longer.
[20:01.70]Cost-cutting lay-offs in the 1980s
[20:05.41]reduce the professional and managerial runs,
[20:08.48]leaving fewer people to get the job done.
[20:11.42]In lower paid occupations
[20:14.91]where wages have been reduced,
[20:16.88]workers have added hours in overtime
[20:19.62]or extra jobs to preserve their living standard.
[20:22.94]The government estimates that more than 7 million people 
[20:26.60]hold a second job.
[20:28.24]For the first time,
[20:30.76]large numbers of people say they want to cut back
[20:33.81]on working hours even it means earning less money.
[20:37.22]But most employers are unwilling to let them do so.
[20:41.07]The government which has stepped back from its traditional role
[20:46.18]as a regulator of work time
[20:48.23]should take steps to make shorter hours possible.
[20:51.85]Questions 32 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:58.47]32. In which country do industrial employees
[21:05.16]work the longest hours?
[21:20.76]33. How do employed Americans manage to work more hours?
[21:40.37]34. Why do corporations press their employees
[21:47.18]to work longer hours according to the speaker?
[22:03.10]35. What does the speaker
[22:07.91]say many Americans prefer to do?
[22:23.32]Section C
[22:25.94]Directions: In this section,
[22:29.11]you will hear a passage three times.
[22:32.00]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:34.82]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:37.90]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:41.06]you are required to fill in the blanks numbered
[22:44.17]from 36 to 43 with the exact words
[22:47.69]you have just heard. For blanks numbered
[22:51.26]from 44 to 46 you are required
[22:54.19]to fill in the missing information.
[22:56.62]For these blanks, you can either use the exact words
[23:00.52]you have just heard or write down the main points
[23:03.91]in your own words. Finally, when the passage
[23:07.67]is read for the third time, you should check
[23:10.19]what you have written.
[23:11.72]Now listen to the passage.
[23:14.99]Nursing, as a typically female profession,
[23:19.67]must deal constantly with the false impression
[23:22.69]that nurses are there to wait on the physician.
[23:25.67]As nurses, we are licensed to provide nursing care only.
[23:31.13]We do not have any legal
[23:33.29]or moral obligation to any physician.
[23:36.11]We provide health teaching, assess physical
[23:40.21]as well as emotional problems,
[23:42.20]coordinate patient-related services,
[23:45.12]and make all of our nursing decisions based upon
[23:48.21]what is best or suitable for the patient.
[23:51.04]If, in any circumstance,
[23:53.57]we feel that a physician¡¯s order
[23:55.68]is inappropriate or unsafe,
[23:58.52]we have a legal responsibility to question
[24:01.51]that order or refuse to carry it out.
[24:04.61]Nursing is not a nine-to-five job with every weekend off.
[24:09.29]All nurses are aware of that before they enter the profession.
[24:13.19]The emotional and physical stress, however,
[24:16.65]that occurs due to odd working hours
[24:19.25]is a prime reason for a lot of the career dissatisfaction.
[24:23.45]It is sometimes required that we work overtime,
[24:27.55]and that we change shifts four or five times a month.
[24:31.76]That disturbs our personal lives,
[24:34.65]disrupts our sleeping and eating habits,
[24:37.68]and isolates us from everything
[24:39.98]except job-related friends and activities.
[24:43.22]The quality of nursing care
[24:45.70]is being affected dramatically by these situations.
[24:49.07]Most hospitals are now staffed by new graduates,
[24:53.37]as experienced nurses
[24:55.58]finally give up trying to change the system.
[24:58.52]Consumers of medically related services
[25:02.08]have evidently not been affected enough yet
[25:05.58]to demand changes in our medical system.
[25:08.40]But if trends continue as predicted,
[25:12.13]they will find that most critical hospital care
[25:15.59]will be provided by new, inexperienced,
[25:19.40]and sometimes inadequately trained nurses.
[25:23.89]Now the passage will be read again.
[25:27.35]Nursing, as a typically female profession,
[25:32.13]must deal constantly with the false impression
[25:35.24]that nurses are there to wait on the physician.

[26:01.38]what is best or suitable for the patient.
[26:04.13]If, in any circumstance,

[28:15.70]finally give up trying to change the system.

[29:37.20]have evidently not been affected enough yet
[29:39.88]to demand changes in our medical system.
[29:42.75]But if trends continue as predicted,
[29:45.67]they will find that most critical hospital care
[29:49.12]will be provided by new, inexperienced,
[29:52.41]and sometimes inadequately trained nurses.
[31:26.21]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[31:29.75]Nursing, as a typically female profession,
[31:34.39]must deal constantly with the false impression
[31:37.57]that nurses are there to wait on the physician.
[31:40.51]As nurses, we are licensed to provide nursing care only.
[31:45.77]We do not have any legal
[31:47.92]or moral obligation to any physician.
[31:50.87]We provide health teaching, assess physical
[31:54.78]as well as emotional problems,
[31:56.81]coordinate patient-related services,
[31:59.89]and make all of our nursing decisions based upon
[32:02.90]what is best or suitable for the patient.
[32:05.59]If, in any circumstance,
[32:08.29]we feel that a physician¡¯s order
[32:10.36]is inappropriate or unsafe,
[32:13.26]we have a legal responsibility to question
[32:16.30]that order or refuse to carry it out.
[32:19.50]Nursing is not a nine-to-five job with every weekend off.
[32:24.06]All nurses are aware of that before they enter the profession.
[32:28.18]The emotional and physical stress, however,
[32:31.43]that occurs due to odd working hours
[32:34.19]is a prime reason for a lot of the career dissatisfaction.
[32:38.43]It is sometimes required that we work overtime,
[32:42.60]and that we change shifts four or five times a month.
[32:46.91]That disturbs our personal lives,
[32:49.64]disrupts our sleeping and eating habits,
[32:52.88]and isolates us from everything
[32:55.58]except job-related friends and activities.
[32:58.42]The quality of nursing care
[33:00.91]is being affected dramatically by these situations.
[33:04.52]Most hospitals are now staffed by new graduates,
[33:09.03]as experienced nurses
[33:10.87]finally give up trying to change the system.
[33:13.99]Consumers of medically related services
[33:17.63]have evidently not been affected enough yet
[33:21.22]to demand changes in our medical system.
[33:23.94]But if trends continue as predicted,
[33:27.52]they will find that most critical hospital care
[33:31.06]will be provided by new, inexperienced,
[33:35.18]and sometimes inadequately trained nurses.
[33:39.29]This is the end of listening comprehension.
