[00:06.89]Test Three
[00:11.49]Part III Listening Comprehension
[00:14.83]Section A
[00:16.80]Directions: In this section,
[00:19.75]you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.
[00:24.35]At the end of each conversation,
[00:26.75]one or more questions will be asked about what was said.
[00:30.15]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:34.52]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:37.81]During the pause,
[00:39.56]you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:45.02]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:48.42]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2
[00:52.14]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.77]Now, let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[00:59.46]11. W: Do you know why Mary has such a long face today?
[01:06.03]M: I don¡¯t have the foggiest idea!
[01:08.11]She should be happy especially since she got a promotion yesterday.
[01:12.49]Q: What did the speakers mean?
[01:31.03]12. M: Hi, Donna! Are you interested in going to
[01:35.51]an art exhibition on Sunday? A friend of mine is
[01:38.68]showing some of her paintings there.
[01:40.88]It¡¯s the opening night. Free drinks and food!
[01:43.94]W: Well, actually, I don¡¯t have anything planned.
[01:46.89]It sounds kind of fun!
[01:49.08]Q: What did the man invite the woman to do on Sunday?
[02:08.68]13. M: You did an excellent job in school!
[02:13.28]You were indeed a great student!
[02:15.47]Where did your drive come from?
[02:17.99]W: Academic achievements were important to my parents as immigrants.
[02:22.36]Education is where it all begins.
[02:25.09]My mother in particular tries to get me interested in school.
[02:28.81]Q: What do we learn about the woman from the conversation?
[02:48.74]14. M: I hear the Sunflower Health Club on Third Street is good!
[02:55.42]W: Not right now! I used to go there.
[02:57.94]I thought it was great because it was real cheap.
[03:00.67]But the problem was it was always crowded.
[03:03.95]Sometimes, I had to wait to use the machines.
[03:06.90]Q: What does the woman say about the Sunflower Health Club?
[03:26.33]15. W: Tom is very excited!
[03:30.15]Just yesterday he received his doctoral degree
[03:32.72]and in a few minutes he¡¯ll be putting the ring on Sarah¡¯s finger.
[03:36.32]M: He¡¯s really such a lucky dog!
[03:38.40]Sarah is a lovely bride and tonight
[03:41.03]they are going to Hawaii on their honeymoon!
[03:43.77]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[04:01.10]16. W: Your wife told me that you eat out four or five times a week,
[04:08.54]I really envy you!
[04:10.18]M: Don¡¯t envy me! It¡¯s for business.
[04:12.26]In fact, I¡¯m sick and tired of restaurant food!
[04:15.65]Sometimes, I just prefer a home-cooked meal.
[04:19.05]Q: Why does the man say he often eats out?
[04:38.64]17. W: I was amazed when I heard Tony play the piano so expertly!
[04:45.00]From the way he talked,
[04:46.64]I thought he was just starting his lessons.
[04:49.05]M: Oh, no! That¡¯s the way he always talks!
[04:52.00]Q: What can we infer about Tony from the conversation?
[05:12.18]18. M: I¡¯m terribly sorry, ma¡¯am,
[05:14.26]but your flight has been cancelled.
[05:17.65]I won¡¯t be able to put you on another one until tomorrow morning.
[05:21.70]W: Well, I certainly hope the airline is going to
[05:24.22]put me up somewhere tonight.
[05:25.75]Q: What did the woman request the airline do?
[05:42.43]Now you¡¯ll hear two long conversations.
[05:48.89]Conversation One
[05:51.30]M: Hi, Hellen, How are you doing?
[05:53.71]W: Pretty good. Thanks. Have you helped me
[05:57.20]look at my graduate school application,
[05:59.50]and the statement of purpose I wrote?
[06:01.91]M: Well, yeah. Basically it¡¯s good.
[06:04.65]What you might actually do is to take some of
[06:07.27]the different points here and actually break them out into
[06:10.33]separate paragraphs, like your purpose for applying for graduate study,
[06:14.60]specialty, and why do you want to do the area you specify,
[06:19.08]what you want to do with your degree when you get it.
[06:22.04]W: Ok, right.
[06:23.46]M: So you may expand on each point.
[06:25.54]Expand some more on what¡¯s happened in your life
[06:28.60]and what shows your motivation and interest in this area?--geology.
[06:31.78]W: Ok, so make it a little more personal? That¡¯s ok?
[06:36.70]M: That¡¯s fine. They look for that stuff.
[06:39.98]It¡¯s critical that somebody see what your passion is
[06:43.15]and your personal motivation for doing this.
[06:45.45]You might give a little more explanation
[06:47.64]about your unique undergraduate background,
[06:49.83]like the music program. What you got from that
[06:52.67]and why you decided to change. I mean it is kind of unusual
[06:56.34]to go from music to geology. Right?
[06:59.07]W: Yeah. I was, I was afraid of that,
[07:02.47]you know, maybe the personal type stuff wouldn¡¯t be
[07:04.86]what they want. But¡­
[07:06.83]M: You know, I think probably your music background
[07:09.45]is the most unique thing that you get your records.
[07:12.07]W: Right.
[07:13.82]M: So you see, you get to make yourself stand out
[07:16.56]from a couple of a hundred of applications.
[07:18.53]Does that help any?
[07:20.60]W: Yeah, it does. It gives me some good ideas.
[07:22.25]M: Also, think about presentation.
[07:25.20]I mean the presentation formats, your grammar,
[07:28.48]and all that stuff they are looking at
[07:30.35]in your materials at the same time.
[07:32.42]W: Right. Ok.
[07:34.61]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the conversation
[07:38.11]you have just heard.
[07:40.41]19. What did the woman ask the man to do?
[07:57.76]20. What was the woman¡¯s major as an undergraduate student?
[08:18.71]21. What was the last suggestion given by the man?
[08:38.45]Conversation Two
[08:41.30]W: This evening, the guest speaker with us
[08:44.14]is Dr. Bush. He¡¯s going to talk about copyrighting works of art.
[08:48.30]M: Well, a copyright is a proof of authorship.
[08:51.91]It protects artists against someone else
[08:54.43]using their work without their permission.
[08:56.62]W: So, all artists¡¯ works will be protected by copyright law?
[09:00.01]M: It¡¯s important to remember that United States Copyright Law
[09:03.18]protects artistic expressions such as paintings,
[09:06.79]but does not protect any ideas, concepts, procedures or techniques.
[09:11.83]W: How can artists obtain copyright protection?
[09:15.43]M: The law has changed in 1978 and again in 1989.
[09:20.03]For artists the current law means everything
[09:22.98]they create is automatically and immediately copyrighted.
[09:26.49]They don¡¯t have to file any documents
[09:28.89]and under the protection of the Copyright Law,
[09:31.30]any recreations of their original work
[09:34.47]such as prints are also covered by the artist¡¯s copyright.
[09:37.86]Further more, any changes artists made to
[09:40.82]their original works are covered. The Law also makes it clear that
[09:44.97]when someone buys the work of art,
[09:46.84]they are not allowed to destroy or change that work of art.
[09:50.22]W: What if the work was sold to a new owner?
[09:52.85]M: Artists keep the copyright even after selling the work of art.
[09:56.90]The purchaser may buy the physical work,
[09:59.52]but the right to make prints or copies is still the artists¡¯
[10:02.70]and the buyer does not automatically have any right to make
[10:06.85]and sell prints or copies of work.
[10:10.57]W: Do you have any suggestions to our artist in this area?
[10:13.97]M: Although works are automatically copyrighted,
[10:16.70]artists are encouraged to register their work with
[10:19.76]United States Copyright Office.
[10:21.84]Registering art provides additional legal protection
[10:24.57]and also gives the people around the world the ability to
[10:27.97]approach the honors about licensing and purchasing right.
[10:31.69]Questions22 to 25 are based on the conversation
[10:35.52]you have just heard.
[10:37.49]22. What is the talk mainly about?
[10:57.78]23. What does the professor say about American Copyright Law?
[11:16.54]24. When does the Artist Copyright start?
[11:36.40]25. What does American Copyright Law state about
[11:41.10]a work of art that is sold?
[11:57.87]Section B
[12:00.06]Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages.
[12:05.09]At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions.
[12:08.70]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[12:12.86]After you hear a question,
[12:14.72]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[12:18.55]marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter
[12:24.34]on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
[12:28.29]Passage One
[12:30.36]You have probably heard of the DuPont company,
[12:33.54]which was founded by a family of the same name.
[12:36.49]But do you know about the museum that
[12:39.23]one of the family members began? Henry Francis du Pont
[12:43.50]was an heir to Delaware¡¯s DuPont Company fortune.
[12:47.00]He was one of the first serious collectors of American
[12:50.72]decorative art objects¡ªfurniture, textiles,
[12:54.44]paintings and other objects made in the United States
[12:58.04]between 1640 and 1840. American furniture
[13:03.41]and household objects had been considered inferior to
[13:07.56]those from Europe. But du Pont helped
[13:10.52]develop a new appreciation of American decorative arts.
[13:14.67]He created a legendary show plays for these objects
[13:18.94]on his family estate just outside Wilmington, Delaware.
[13:23.09]In 1951, it was open to the public as the Henry Francis
[13:28.46]du Pont Winterthur Museum. The museum assembled objects
[13:33.71]from du Pont¡¯s collection into 175 period rooms,
[13:38.41]each with examples of American antiques and decorative arts
[13:42.79]that followed a certain theme or period in early American history.
[13:47.60]For example, the DuPont dining room has furniture
[13:51.43]dating from the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
[13:55.37]And because this was the time when the United States
[13:59.10]became a new nation, there¡¯s a patriotic theme in the room.
[14:03.36]Another example is the Chinese parlor,
[14:06.86]which has furnishings that would reflect American¡¯s fascination
[14:11.12]with Asian culture during the 18th century.
[14:14.30]In these period rooms, du Pont believed
[14:18.24]he could tell the story of the early United States
[14:21.63]through furniture and other decorative arts.
[14:25.24]Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[14:32.68]26. What is Henry Francis du Pont noted for?
[14:54.25]27. What was the purpose of du Pont¡¯s efforts?
[15:14.92]28. How were the objects on display arranged?
[15:35.21]Passage Two
[15:37.28]According to David Grattle, a British language expert,
[15:40.89]the idea that English will become the world language is outdated.
[15:44.50]And people are more likely to switch
[15:47.78]between two or more languages for routine communication in the future.
[15:52.38]The share of the world¡¯s population that speaks English
[15:56.21]as a native language is falling. Instead,
[15:59.38]English will play a growing role as a second language.
[16:02.88]A population speaking more than one language
[16:06.38]is already the case in much of the world
[16:09.01]and is becoming more common in the United States.
[16:12.18]Indeed, the census bureau reported last year that
[16:15.80]nearly one American in five speaks a language
[16:19.07]other than English at home, with Spanish taking the lead,
[16:22.68]followed by Chinese. Grattle works for British consulting
[16:27.72]and publishing business. He anticipates a world
[16:31.33]with the share of people who are native English speakers
[16:34.28]slips from 9% in the mid 1990s to 5% in 2050. Grattle says,
[16:42.16]¡°Up until 1995, English was the second most common native tongue
[16:46.97]in the world, trailing only Chinese.
[16:50.81]By 2050, Chinese will continue its predominance
[16:55.07]with Hindi Woodoo of India and Arabic climbing past English
[16:59.67]and Spanish nearly equal to it.¡± In contrast,
[17:03.49]an American language expert, David Harrison noted that
[17:07.11]the global share of English is much larger
[17:09.73]if you count second language speakers,
[17:12.36]and will continue to rise even as the proportion
[17:15.64]of native speakers declines. Harrison disputed listing Arabic
[17:20.89]in the top three languages because varieties of Arabic
[17:24.50]spoken in such countries as Egypt and Morocco
[17:27.78]are mutually incomprehensible.
[17:30.85]Questions 29 to 31 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:37.74]29. What does David Grattle say about the use of
[17:43.86]languages for daily communication in the future?
[18:01.97]30. Why doesn¡¯t David Harrison include Arabic
[18:08.09]as one of the top three languages?
[18:24.64]31. What can we infer from the passage?
[18:46.24]Passage Three
[18:47.88]There are about 1 million blind people in the United States.
[18:52.37]The largest and most influential organization of blind people
[18:56.64]in this country is the National Federation of the Blind.
[19:00.57]Its officials say the nation doesn¡¯t have any colleges
[19:04.85]or universities that serve only blind students.
[19:08.23]They say the reason for this is that blind people
[19:12.17]must learn to live among people who can see.
[19:15.34]American colleges and universities do accept blind
[19:20.16]and visually impaired students,
[19:23.12]and they provide services to help these students succeed.
[19:27.27]For example, colleges find people who write down
[19:30.78]what the professor say in class and they provide technology
[19:35.15]that can help blind students with their work.
[19:38.21]However, experts say colleges can best help blind students
[19:43.03]by making it clear that the students
[19:45.76]should learn to help themselves.
[19:48.06]One blind American student named Timcordez recently
[19:53.75]made news because he graduated from medical school
[19:56.59]at the University of Wisconsin. He said technology
[20:00.42]was one of the reasons he succeeded.
[20:02.83]He used a computer that read into his earphone
[20:06.77]what he was typing. He also used a small printer that
[20:10.71]permitted him to write notes about his patients in the hospital.
[20:14.54]He did his undergraduate work at the University of Notre Dame
[20:19.35]in South Bend, Indiana. National Federation of
[20:24.71]the Blind officials say blind students from other nations do
[20:28.43]come to the United States to attend college.
[20:31.06]Some can even get financial aid.
[20:33.90]The Federation awards about 30 scholarships each year
[20:38.71]that have no citizenship requirement.
[20:41.56]Questions 32 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:49.32]32. According to officials of the National Federation of the Blind,
[20:55.56]why are there no special colleges for blind students only?
[21:14.21]33. According to experts, how can colleges best help blind students?
[21:37.24]34. What is one of the reasons given by Timcodez ,
[21:42.05]a blind student , for his success?
[21:59.91]35. What can blind students from overseas do to study
[22:04.83]in America according to the National Federation of the Blind?
[22:23.59]Section C
[22:25.24]Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times.
[22:30.92]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:33.77]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:36.83]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:40.01]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:43.07]numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:47.99]For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to
[22:53.35]fill in the missing information. For these blanks,
[22:57.07]you can either use the exact words you have just heard or
[23:01.12]write down the main points in your own words.
[23:04.07]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[23:07.90]you should check what you have written.
[23:11.18]Now listen to the passage.
[23:13.70]People could eat more cocoa-rich products
[23:17.75]such as dark chocolate but not drink tea
[23:20.26]if they want to lower their blood pressure,
[23:22.67]German researchers reported Monday.
[23:25.19]A team of researchers from the University Hospital of
[23:30.22]Cologne analyzed data from previous studies that
[23:32.85]looked at the benefits of tea and cocoa.
[23:35.14]They found eating foods affluent in cocoa resulted
[23:38.53]in lower blood pressure levels.
[23:40.51]Their report consisted of exactly 10 studies on cocoa
[23:44.22]with a total of 173 participants,
[23:47.29]a third of whom had high blood pressure
[23:49.59]and were followed for a two-week period,
[23:51.99]and five tea studies with 343 people for a four-week period.
[23:57.14]The fall in blood pressure credited to cocoa
[24:00.53]could be expected to reduce the risk of strokes
[24:02.98]and heart attacks by 10-20 percent, the report said.
[24:06.91]The benefits are believed to come from certain compounds,
[24:10.74]explained Dr. Dirk Taubert, a leading author of the report.
[24:15.56]While tea and cocoa are both rich in such compounds,
[24:19.05]cocoa contains more of the type.
[24:21.79]This suggests that different kinds of plant compounds
[24:24.20]may make contributions to lowering blood pressure
[24:27.92]in different ways. Compared to cocoa compounds,
[24:31.20]tea compounds appear to be less effective.
[24:33.72]However, the researchers cautioned that
[24:36.56]while their findings should not be taken as
[24:38.53]a widespread recommendation for higher cocoa
[24:41.70]intake to decrease blood pressure,
[24:43.56]it appears reasonable that cocoa products
[24:46.08]could be substituted for other high calorie
[24:48.82]and high fat desserts.
[24:50.78]Drug treatment is the basis of blood pressure control,
[24:53.41]Taubert said, and it should always be accompanied
[24:56.25]by lifestyle measures such as exercise and proper diet.
[25:00.63]Now the passage will be read again.
[25:06.10]People could eat more cocoa-rich products
[25:09.38]such as dark chocolate but not drink tea

[26:17.54]lowering blood pressure in different ways.
[27:27.15]Compared to cocoa compounds,

[27:34.92]However, the researchers cautioned that

[28:58.79]other high calorie and high fat desserts.
[29:02.18]Drug treatment is the basis of blood pressure control,
[29:04.92]Taubert said, and it should always be accompanied
[29:07.98]by lifestyle measures such as exercise and proper diet.
[30:18.10]Now the passage will be read for the third time.

[31:11.92]could be expected to reduce the risk of strokes
[31:14.87]and heart attacks by 10-20 percent, the report said.
[31:19.47]The benefits are believed to come from certain compounds,
[31:23.08]explained Dr. Dirk Taubert, a leading author of the report.
[31:27.16]While tea and cocoa are both rich in such compounds,
[31:30.67]cocoa contains more of the type. This suggests that
[31:34.60]different kinds of plant compounds may make contributions to
[31:38.10]lowering blood pressure in different ways.
[31:40.73]Compared to cocoa compounds,
[31:42.59]tea compounds appear to be less effective.
[31:45.32]However, the researchers cautioned that
[31:48.06]while their findings should not be taken as
[31:50.58]a widespread recommendation for higher cocoa
[31:53.42]intake to decrease blood pressure,
[31:55.39]it appears reasonable that cocoa products
[31:57.90]could be substituted for other high calorie
[32:01.41]and high fat desserts.
[32:02.83]Drug treatment is the basis of blood pressure control,
[32:05.02]Taubert said, and it should always be accompanied
[32:08.19]by lifestyle measures such as exercise and proper diet.
[32:12.24]This is the end of listening comprehension.
