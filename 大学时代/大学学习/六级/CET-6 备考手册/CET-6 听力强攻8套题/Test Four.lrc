[00:07.55]Test Four
[00:10.39]Part III    Listening Comprehension
[00:13.67]Section A
[00:16.08]Directions: In this section,
[00:19.03]you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.
[00:23.63]At the end of each conversation,
[00:25.93]one or more questions will be asked about what was said.
[00:29.21]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:34.02]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:37.30]During the pause, you must read the four choices
[00:41.13]marked A), B), C) and D), and decide which is the best answer.
[00:46.93]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2
[00:51.64]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.37]Now, let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[00:58.86]11. M:   Mary, could you please tell Thomas to contact me?
[01:04.43]I was hoping he be able to help out
[01:07.28]with the freshman orientation program next week.
[01:09.47]W:  I would certainly tell him if I saw him,
[01:12.10]but I haven¡¯t seen him around for quite a few days.
[01:15.49]Q:  What does the woman mean?
[01:33.65]12. M:  Susan, I am going to change the light bulb
[01:38.68]above the dining room table.
[01:40.87]Will you hold the ladder for me?
[01:42.95]W:  No problem. But be careful while you¡¯re up there.
[01:46.56]Q:  What does the man want the woman to do?
[02:04.88]13. W:  It¡¯s freezing cold. Let me make some coffee
[02:11.01]to warm us up. Do you want a piece of pie as well?
[02:14.18]M:  Coffee sounds great! But I am going to have dinner
[02:17.25]with some friends in a while, so I¡¯d better skip the pie.
[02:20.85]Q:  What does the man mean?
[02:38.71]14. M:  Hello, Mary. This is Paul at the bank. Is Tony home?
[02:45.71]W:  Not yet, Paul. I don¡¯t think you can reach him
[02:49.21]at the office now, either. He phoned me five minutes ago
[02:52.60]to say he was stopping for a haircut on his way home.
[02:55.78]Q:  Who do you think the woman probably is?
[03:14.87]15. W:  Oh! Boy! I don¡¯t understand
[03:19.67]how you got a ticket today. I always thought you were slow
[03:23.61]even driving on the less crowded fast lane.
[03:26.46]M:  I am usually careful, but this time I thought
[03:29.30]I could get through the intersection before the light turned.
[03:32.91]Q:  What do we learn about the man?
[03:52.33]16. M:  I¡¯m afraid there won¡¯t be time
[03:56.70]to do another tooth today. Make sure you don¡¯t eat
[03:59.76]anything like steaks for the next few hours
[04:02.61]and we will fill the other cavity tomorrow.
[04:05.46]W:  All right. Actually I must hurry to
[04:08.41]the library to return some books.
[04:11.04]Q:  Where does the conversation most probably take place?
[04:30.12]17. W:  I am worried about Jenny going to college.
[04:35.70]College students are so wild nowadays.
[04:39.31]M:  Actually only a few are like that.
[04:41.72]Most students are too busy studying
[04:44.01]to have time to cause trouble.
[04:46.75]Q:  What does the man imply?
[05:04.75]18. W:  You didn¡¯t seem terribly enthusiastic
[05:09.12]about the performance.
[05:10.54]M:  You must be kidding. I couldn¡¯t have clapped any harder.
[05:13.39]My hands are still hurting.
[05:15.47]Q:  What does the man think of the performance?
[05:34.34]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.
[05:37.65]Conversation One
[05:40.49]M: Excuse me, Prof. Thomson.
[05:42.90]I know your office hours are tomorrow,
[05:45.30]but I was wondering if you have a few minutes free
[05:47.49]now to discuss something.
[05:49.14]W: Sure, John. What do you want to talk about?
[05:51.44]M: Well, I have some quick problems about
[05:54.39]how to write the research project that
[05:57.23]I do this semester about Climate Changes.
[06:00.19]W: Oh, yes. You were looking for changes in climate
[06:02.81]in the G city area, right? How far have you been gotten?
[06:06.20]M: I¡¯ve gotten my data,
[06:08.17]so I¡¯m starting to summarize it now,
[06:10.14]preparing graph and stuff. But I¡¯m just¡­I¡¯m looking at it
[06:14.52]and I¡¯m afraid that is not enough,
[06:16.71]but I¡¯m not sure what else to put into the report.
[06:19.00]W: I hear the same thing from every student.
[06:21.74]You know, you have to remember now that
[06:24.03]you are the expert on what you have done.
[06:26.01]So think about what you need to include
[06:28.41]if you¡¯re going to explain your research project to someone
[06:30.93]with general or casual knowledge about
[06:33.66]the subject like your parents. That¡¯s usually my rule¡­
[06:36.95]Would my parents understand this?
[06:39.14]M: Uhh, I get it. I was wondering
[06:41.87]if I should also include the notes from
[06:43.95]the research journals you suggest.
[06:45.92]W: Yes, definitely. Be sure you include good reference section
[06:49.09]where all your published and unpublished data came from.
[06:52.16]M: Yes. ¡­ I have data more than just in the G city area,
[06:57.29]so I also include regional data in the report.
[06:59.70]With everything else, it should be a pretty good indication
[07:02.98]of climate of this part of the state.
[07:05.61]W: Sounds good. I¡¯ll be happy to look over
[07:08.02]a draft before you hand the final copy if you wish.
[07:11.41]M: Great. I plan to get you the draft of the paper
[07:14.91]by next Friday. Thanks very much. See you.
[07:17.97]W: Ok.
[07:20.16]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:24.42]19. What did the student want to talk with the professor?
[07:45.43]20. What is the professor¡¯s suggestion to the student?
[08:03.75]21. What will probably happen next?
[08:24.37]Conversation Two
[08:27.10]M: I¡¯d like to share with you today my experience
[08:29.84]with a new approach to building a house.
[08:31.92]It¡¯s called Envelop Building.
[08:34.33]W: Hmm, it sounds interesting.
[08:36.29]Please share with us. What does it mean?
[08:38.59]M: Essentially, what it means is that as you are building a house,
[08:42.96]you try to leave the landscape feature on the land,
[08:45.92]especially the vegetation in the original condition.
[08:49.09]So what you are not doing is the usual practice of land-scraping.
[08:53.47]By which I mean literally scraping or cleaning the land of any
[08:57.51]and all the original plants.
[08:59.93]W: Why is the approach called Envelop Building?
[09:02.44]M: Good question!  Because instead of clearing everything away,
[09:05.94]you let your original landscape elements envelop
[09:09.55]or surround your house. Let the vegetation physical features
[09:13.71]such as hills and slopes or interesting rock formations,
[09:18.08]constitute a significant part of
[09:20.49]the character of the building site.
[09:22.35]The design of the house should take these features of
[09:25.31]the land into account.
[09:27.39]W: Any more information about Envelop Building?
[09:29.57]It is a recent technology?
[09:31.44]M: Actually integrating your original wild landscape
[09:34.71]with a house is not that new.
[09:36.79]The famous American architect Wright was doing it
[09:39.97]about 65 years ago. Envelop Building is not as easy as
[09:44.34]it sounds though. It¡¯s not just that you build your house
[09:47.08]and leave the land alone. By building,
[09:50.14]you are already damaging the original landscape.
[09:52.88]But as architects, we should try to work with environment,
[09:56.49]not against it. A creative architect can find ways
[10:00.20]to incorporate natural landscape into the overall design.
[10:03.59]W: I guess this technology will be acknowledged by more architects.
[10:08.20]Questions22 to 25 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:13.56]22. According to the professor,
[10:17.28]what does the term ¡°land scaping¡± refer to?
[10:35.49]23. In Envelop Building,
[10:39.19]what is done with the landscape features of a building site?
[10:56.86]24. Why does the professor mention the architect Wright?
[11:17.47]25. What suggestion did the professor give to architects?
[11:37.71]Section B
[11:39.90]Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:46.24]At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions.
[11:50.40]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[11:55.21]After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer
[11:58.61]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:04.73]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2
[12:09.11]with a single line through the centre.
[12:11.73]Passage One
[12:16.33]Born and raised in central Ohio,
[12:17.97]I am a country girl through and through.
[12:20.71]I am currently studying to become a physical therapist,
[12:23.99]a career path that marks a greater achievement for me.
[12:27.60]At the Ohio State University,
[12:30.00]admission into the physical therapy program is
[12:33.06]intensively competitive. I made it pass the first
[12:36.57]cut the first year I applied, but was turned down for admission.
[12:41.05]I was crushed because for years I have been determined to
[12:45.21]become a physical therapist. I received the advice from friends
[12:49.81]and relatives about changing my major
[12:52.00]and finding another course for my life.
[12:54.62]I just couldn¡¯t do it. I knew I could not be
[12:57.79]as happy in another profession. So I stilled myself,
[13:00.96]began to work seriously for another year and reapplied.
[13:05.45]Happily I received notice of my admission.
[13:08.85]Later I found out that less than 15% of the applicants
[13:13.33]had been offered positions that year.
[13:15.63]Now, in the first two years¡¯ professional training,
[13:19.24]I could not be happier with my decision not to
[13:22.41]give up all my dream. My father told me that
[13:26.13]if I wanted it badly enough, I would get in.
[13:29.30]Well, daddy, I wanted it, so there.
[13:32.25]After graduation, I would like to travel to another country,
[13:36.52]possibly a Latin-American country
[13:39.26]and work in a children¡¯s hospital for a year or two.
[13:42.76]So many of children there are physically handicapped,
[13:46.37]but most hospitals don¡¯t have the funding to
[13:49.43]hire a trained staff to care for them properly.
[13:52.28]I would like to change that somehow.
[13:55.67]Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[14:02.56]26. What is the speaker¡¯s field of study?
[14:23.10]27. According to the speaker, what contributed to
[14:29.22]her admission to Ohio State University?
[14:46.64]28. Why does the speaker want to go to a Latin-American country?
[15:08.68]Passage Two
[15:10.54]Gabriela Mistral was once an ordinary teacher
[15:15.32]in a small village school in Northern Chile.
[15:18.38]Towering mountains separated her village
[15:21.00]from the world outside. Gabriela Mistral was
[15:25.16]only fifteen when she began teaching,
[15:27.79]but she was a good teacher. She helped the minds of
[15:30.96]her students scale the mountain walls
[15:33.37]and reached out to the world beyond.
[15:35.99]For eighteen years, Gabriela devoted her life
[15:39.82]to the poor farm children of Chile¡¯s northern valleys.
[15:43.65]During part of this time,
[15:45.73]she was director of schools in all of the Chile.
[15:48.25]Before long, many countries recognized her
[15:51.75]as a great friend of children and a leader in education.
[15:55.79]In 1922, she was invited to Mexico to
[15:59.73]help organize the Rural School System.
[16:02.68]Two years later, Gabriela Mistral came to the United States
[16:07.28]where she served as a visiting professor in several colleges.
[16:11.66]In New York City, a group of teachers helped to
[16:14.94]finance the publication of her first book of poetry.
[16:18.77]Some of her books have been translated into
[16:21.83]six different languages. She gave the income from
[16:25.55]some of her books to help poor and neglected children.
[16:29.27]Beginning in the 1920s, her interests reached out
[16:33.21]to broader fields. Statesmen asked her advice on
[16:37.26]international problems. She tried to break through
[16:40.65]the national barriers that hindered the exchange of ideas
[16:44.70]among the Spanish-speaking people of South America.
[16:47.98]She tried to develop a better understanding
[16:50.39]between the United States and countries of Latin America.
[16:54.22]In 1945, she gained worldwide recognition
[16:58.92]by winning the Nobel Prize in literature,
[17:01.98]the first South American to win the prize.
[17:07.02]Questions 29 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:12.27]29. Where did Gabriela Mistral start her teaching career?
[17:33.96]30. How did Gabriela Mistral help
[17:38.23]the poor children of her hometown?
[17:55.90]31. Why did many countries think highly of Gabriela Mistral?
[18:16.20]32. How did Gabriela Mistral become famous all over the world?
[18:39.00]Passage Three
[18:40.96]Over time animals have developed many ways to
[18:44.57]stay away from predators.
[18:46.21]A predator is an animal that hunts and eats other animals.
[18:50.48]Hiding is one of the best ways to stay alive.
[18:53.98]Some animals hide by looking like the places
[18:57.26]where they live. To see how this works,
[19:00.44]let¡¯s look at the sea dragon. It is a master of disguise.
[19:04.93]The sea dragon is covered with skin that looks like leaves.
[19:09.19]The skin helps the dragon look like a piece of seaweed.
[19:13.13]A hungry meat-eater would stay away from anything
[19:16.30]that looks like seaweed. Other animals stay safe
[19:21.01]by showing their colors. They want other animals to see them.
[19:25.60]Scientists call these bright colors warning colors.
[19:29.64]You have probably seen animals that have warning colors.
[19:33.37]Some grasshoppers show off their own bright colors.
[19:37.75]Those colors don¡¯t just look attractive.
[19:40.92]They tell the enemies to stay away.
[19:43.54]Of course, hungry predators sometimes ignore the warning.
[19:47.81]They still go after the grasshopper.
[19:50.76]If that happens, the grasshopper has a backup of defense.
[19:53.83]It makes lots of foam. The foam tastes so bad that
[19:58.42]the predator won¡¯t do it again.
[20:00.83]Color doesn¡¯t offer enough protection for some other animals.
[20:05.20]They have different defenses that help them survive in the wild.
[20:09.14]Many fish live in groups or schools.
[20:12.32]That¡¯s because there is safety in numbers.
[20:15.31]At the first sign of trouble, schooling fish swim
[20:19.25]as close together as they can get.
[20:21.66]Then the school of fish makes lots of twists and turns.
[20:25.71]All that movement makes it hard for predators to see individuals
[20:30.63]in a large group.
[20:32.61]Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:38.40]33. What is the speaker mainly talking about?
[20:58.76]34. What protects the sea dragon from a meat-eater¡¯s attack?
[21:19.34]35. According to the passage, why do many fish stay in groups?
[21:42.98]Section C
[21:45.17]Directions: In this section,
[21:47.69]you will hear a passage three times.
[21:50.53]When the passage is read for the first time,
[21:53.26]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[21:56.33]When the passage is read for the second time,
[21:59.39]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:02.24]numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words you
[22:06.39]have just heard. For blanks numbered from 44 to 46
[22:11.53]you are required to fill in the missing information.
[22:14.49]For these blanks, you can either use the exact words
[22:18.87]you have just heard or write down the main points
[22:22.26]in your own words. Finally, when the passage is read
[22:26.30]for the third time, you should check what you have written.
[22:29.70]Now listen to the passage.
[22:33.63]For some educators, there is nothing wrong
[22:37.46]with fun and games. A group called the Education Arcade
[22:41.62]recently held a conference in Los Angeles to
[22:44.79]discuss the future of educational games,
[22:47.42]and it brings together international game designers,
[22:50.48]publishers, teachers and policymakers.
[22:53.88]The Education Arcade commenced at
[22:56.61]the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, near Boston.
[22:59.67]Professors cooperated with the Microsoft Company
[23:02.74]to create what they called the Games-to-Teach Project.
[23:05.58]The group began to explore techniques to
[23:08.75]use technology in teaching and learning.
[23:11.05]They worked with game designers to develop ideas about
[23:14.77]how mathematics and science could associate with game playing.
[23:18.60]The group recently announced that
[23:21.00]a ¡°Games for Learning¡± statement will be placed
[23:23.85]on some products. The goal is to help people find games that
[23:27.57]are recreational but will also teach.
[23:30.30]The Entertainment Software Association says
[23:32.60]approximately fifty percent of all Americans at age six and
[23:36.87]older play computer and video games. Sales of such games
[23:41.03]in the United States grew eight percent last year,
[23:44.20]to seven-thousand-million dollars.
[23:46.72]Experts say developing a successful computer game
[23:50.11]can take millions of dollars and years of work.
[23:52.95]They say many companies are not willing to invest that
[23:56.67]much money and time in educational games
[23:59.41]when other kinds sell better.
[24:01.70]Still, companies have been creating systems
[24:04.88]like hand-held educational devices made by LeapFrog.
[24:08.48]And new educational role-playing games
[24:11.11]are being developed on the basis of the results from
[24:14.09]recent surveys and related research. For example,
[24:17.48]M.I.T. is developing a game so that players will
[24:20.98]get to experience the American Revolution online.
[24:25.24]Now the passage will be read again.

[30:57.48]Sales of such games in the United States
[31:00.54]grew eight percent last year,
[31:02.29]to seven-thousand-million dollars.
[31:05.02]Experts say developing a successful computer game
[31:08.30]can take millions of dollars and years of work.
[31:11.04]They say many companies are not willing to invest that
[31:14.86]much money and time in educational games
[31:17.66]when other kinds sell better.
[31:19.85]Still, companies have been creating systems
[31:22.92]like hand-held educational devices made by LeapFrog.
[31:26.86]And new educational role-playing games
[31:29.15]are being developed on the basis of the results from
[31:31.89]recent surveys and related research. For example,
[31:35.39]M.I.T. is developing a game so that players will
[31:38.78]get to experience the American Revolution online.
[31:41.96]This is the end of listening comprehension.
