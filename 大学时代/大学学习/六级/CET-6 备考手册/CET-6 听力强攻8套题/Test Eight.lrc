[00:06.18]Test Eight
[00:07.86]Part ¢ó Listening Comprehension
[00:10.99]Section A
[00:12.41]Directions: In this section,
[00:14.98]you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.
[00:19.16]At the end of each conversation,
[00:21.64]one or more questions will be asked about what was said.
[00:25.25]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:30.17]After each question there will be a pause.
[00:33.45]During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:40.23]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:42.76]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2
[00:47.78]with a single line through the centre.
[00:50.19]Now let's begin with the 8 short conversations.
[00:56.32]11. M: Honey, you've got to drink lots of water.
[01:02.01]It will wash away the infection in your eyes.
[01:05.18]W: I have been doing that all these days and I feel much better.
[01:09.56]Q: Why does the woman drink so much water?
[01:28.46]12. M: Hello, Mary, this is Dam Morrison from the office.
[01:34.60]I'm calling to see how Tom is feeling today.
[01:37.56]If he is not so well, I may arrange someone else to do his work instead.
[01:42.70]W: Oh, hello, Mr.Morrison.
[01:44.23]The doctor said he'd be able to go back to work tomorrow.
[01:48.06]Q: What can we learn about Tom from the conversation?
[02:08.57]13. M: How are you going with your English morning report?
[02:13.74]It is your turn next Monday morning.
[02:16.26]Usually you do everything very well,
[02:18.99]so all of us are expecting your presentation.
[02:21.62]W: I have spent a whole week searching online
[02:24.68]for the related information but nothing valuable came up.
[02:28.62]Q: How did the woman go with her morning report?
[02:47.82]14. M: Before the weather report,
[02:52.10]could you tell me some road news?
[02:54.07]W: Yes, well, the A4l is still very busy at the Dome corner this morning.
[03:00.20]Another traffic jam we have is in the A1M up near Hatfield, Harrow Road.
[03:06.97]The A404, Harrow Road is now flowing freely, no problems there.
[03:12.44]Q: What do we learn about the roads from the conversation?
[03:31.69]15. M: Susan, I feel so happy now.
[03:37.15]I've just got the news that I've won the scholarship for the next school year.
[03:41.86]W: You certainly deserve it.
[03:43.61]Q: What does the woman mean?
[04:00.90]16. W: Professor Smith has helped me so much that
[04:06.04]I'm thinking of presenting him a book of poetry.
[04:09.10]M: I think you'd better get him a music record.
[04:12.05]Just because he's a language teacher doesn't mean all he does is reading.
[04:16.64]Q: What does the man mean?
[04:34.22]17. M: It's mostly blue and green with a pattern of flowers in the middle.
[04:40.34]There's a dark green border.
[04:41.99]W: Yes, it matches the curtains well.
[04:44.83]We are going to put it down in the sitting room.
[04:47.12]Q: What are they talking about?
[05:04.53]18. W: I have been waiting here for almost half an hour.
[05:09.55]Why did you take so long to park the car?
[05:12.07]M: I'm sorry. I have driven two blocks before I spotted a place to park.
[05:16.34]Q: What do you learn from the conversation?
[05:34.57]Now you'll hear two long conversations.
[05:39.71]Conversation One
[05:41.68]M: Hey, Jane. What's so interesting?
[05:44.74]W: Hi, Tom. I'm reading this fascinating article on the societies of the Ice Age.
[05:50.65]M: The Ice Age? There weren't any societies then,
[05:54.26]just a group of people living in the cave.
[05:56.99]W: That's what people used to think.
[05:59.18]But a new exhibit of the America Museum of Natural History
[06:03.56]showed Ice Age people were surprisingly advanced.
[06:07.27]You may never hear of it.
[06:09.13]M: Oh, really? In what ways?
[06:10.77]W: Well, Ice Age people were the inventors of language,
[06:15.15]art, and music as we know it.
[06:17.34]And they didn't live in caves, they built their own shelters.
[06:21.93]M: What did they use to build them?
[06:24.12]The cold weather would have killed off most of the trees
[06:27.18]so they couldn't have used wood.
[06:28.93]Of course they couldn't live in the ice blocks.
[06:31.78]W: In some of the warmer climates,
[06:34.62]they did build the houses of wood.
[06:37.14]In other places, they used animal bones and skins or lived in natural stone shelters.
[06:44.14]M: How did they stay warm?
[06:46.11]Animal skin walls don't sound very sturdy.
[06:49.39]W: Well, it says here that in the early Ice Age,
[06:53.00]they often faced the house towards south to take the advantage of the sun,
[06:58.25]a primitive sort of solar heating.
[07:01.20]M: Hey, that's pretty smart.
[07:02.84]But when night comes, it is still a problem to keep warm.
[07:05.91]W: They had some solution.
[07:07.88]People in the late Ice Age even insulated their homes by putting heated stones on the floor.
[07:15.17]They also have some creative ways to make their life better.
[07:18.45]M: All these sound interesting.
[07:20.52]Can I read that magazine article after you're done?
[07:23.59]I think I can use some of the knowledge for my recent paper.
[07:27.20]W: Yes, sure.
[07:28.84]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[07:35.84]19. What did the man think of the people in the Ice Age?
[07:57.59]20. What did the people in the Ice Age invent?
[08:18.02]21. How did people in the early Ice Age keep warm?
[08:38.42]22. What does the man want the woman to do?
[08:58.42]Conversation Two
[08:59.40]W: Good morning. Housing office, how can I help you?
[09:03.34]M: Hi. I'm calling about the new low-cost housing for graduate students.
[09:08.04]W: Are you aware that it's only available to married graduate students and their families?
[09:13.40]M: Yes. I think my wife and I may qualify since she's still in graduate school.
[09:18.43]But I was wondering whether there were any other requirements.
[09:21.82]W: Well, unless you have more than one child,
[09:25.11]you both have to have an annual income not less than 15 000 dollars.
[09:31.24]You may be qualified if you are in the above condition.
[09:34.74]M: I'm working as a part-time research assistant
[09:37.69]so that's no problem. But right now we're living with my wife's parents.
[09:41.85]Does that mean we have to include their income too?
[09:44.91]W: Not necessarily.
[09:46.44]M: I may have lots of questions to ask. Sorry for taking you so much time.
[09:51.36]But I may still have a couple of questions to ask.
[09:54.86]W: Don't worry. Why don't you stop by our office
[09:58.14]so I can give you some forms to fill out and explain everything in more detail?
[10:02.96]M: That sounds like a good idea.
[10:05.14]Would tomorrow morning be all right?
[10:06.68]W: The afternoon might be better.
[10:08.54]It can be pretty crazy around here on a Friday morning.
[10:11.93]M: All right then. I'll try to make it in the afternoon.
[10:15.21]Is there anyone special I should ask for?
[10:18.16]W: You can ask for me, Susan Davidson.
[10:20.68]Or ask my assistant Bill Brown,
[10:23.52]if I'm not available when you are here.
[10:25.71]M: Thanks so much for your help. I'll be there this Friday afternoon.
[10:29.52]W: Glad that I can help. You are welcome! Bye-bye!
[10:32.93]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:39.78]23. Why does the man call the woman?
[11:00.00]24. Where does the man live?
[11:18.29]25. Why does the woman suggest that the man visit her office in the afternoon?
[11:40.44]Section B
[11:42.03]Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:48.69]At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions.
[11:53.28]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[11:58.43]After you hear a question,
[12:01.05]you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[12:07.94]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
[12:14.29]Passage 1
[12:16.37]Reading to oneself is a modern activity
[12:20.42]which was almost unknown to the scholars of the classical and medieval worlds,
[12:26.32]while during the fifteenth century the term ¡°reading¡±
[12:30.37]undoubtedly meant reading aloud.
[12:32.78]Only during the nineteenth century did silent reading become commonplace.
[12:38.36]One should be careful, however,
[12:41.20]in assuming that silent reading came about simply
[12:45.36]because reading aloud is a distraction to others.
[12:48.64]Examination of factors related to the historical development
[12:53.35]of silent reading reveals that it became the usual mode of reading
[12:58.60]for most adult reading tasks mainly
[13:02.31]because the tasks themselves changed in character.
[13:05.60]The 19th century saw a steady gradual increase in literacy,
[13:11.06]and thus in the number of readers.
[13:13.47]As readers increased, so the number of potential listeners decreased,
[13:18.83]and thus there was some reduction in the need to read aloud.
[13:22.99]As reading for the benefit of listeners grew less common,
[13:27.37]so came the flourishing of reading as a private activity
[13:31.63]in such public places as libraries, railway carriages and offices.
[13:37.76]There reading aloud would cause distraction to other readers.
[13:42.36]Towards the end of the century
[13:44.86]there was still considerable argument over
[13:47.71]whether books should be used for information,
[13:50.34]and over whether the reading material
[13:52.74]such as newspapers was in some way mentally weakening.
[13:57.34]Indeed this argument remains with us still in education.
[14:01.71]However, whatever its virtues are, the old shared literacy culture had gone and was replaced
[14:09.48]by the mass media on the one hand and by books and magazines for a specialized readership on the other.
[14:16.38]The social, cultural, and technological changes in the century
[14:21.08]had greatly altered what the term ¡°reading¡± implied.
[14:24.80]Questions 26 to 29 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[14:32.56]26. Why was reading aloud common before the 19th century?
[14:55.30]27. What did the development of silent reading during the 19th century indicate?
[15:18.47]28. What are educationalists still arguing about?
[15:39.00]29. What is the speaker attempting to do?
[15:59.23]Passage 2
[16:00.21]Stress is a very normal part of life.
[16:03.49]Most people feel stress at some time in their lives.
[16:07.32]It doesn't come from an event itself,
[16:10.06]that is, from the things that are happening in our lives.
[16:13.45]It comes from the meaning we give to what has happened.
[16:17.17]We can experience stress any time we don't feel we have control.
[16:22.20]It is the body's way of showing anxiety or worry.
[16:26.25]Stress is not just caused by our mental or emotional condition;
[16:31.61]it is also influenced by how tired we are,
[16:35.11]whether we have a balanced diet with enough vitamins and minerals,
[16:39.37]whether we get enough physical exercise, and whether we can relax.
[16:43.31]If we feel stressed, there are several things that we can do.
[16:47.90]First, we need to learn how to relax and breathe slowly and smoothly.
[16:53.05]We can also take some time out of our worried,
[16:56.55]busy schedule to notice the small things in life.
[17:00.05]Smell the air, look at the flowers,
[17:02.46]notice the small designs in the leaves on a tree¡ª
[17:05.84]these activities can do much to quiet us and to give ourselves a small break in a busy schedule.
[17:12.85]We need to take care of our bodies.
[17:15.70]Being tired makes it easier for us to get sick and to develop physical problems related to stress.
[17:22.70]We need to get enough rest, eat well, and do some regular exercise.
[17:27.72]Finally, we need to find out what is causing the stress in our lives.
[17:32.87]Once we have found it, we need to begin to change that part of our lives.
[17:37.24]If we believe that we can control stress, we can begin to control our lives.
[17:42.60]Questions 30 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:48.12]30. Which of the following causes stress according to the speaker?
[18:10.08]31. When can we experience stress?
[18:28.44]32. What can help us get rid of stress?
[18:47.78]Passage 3
[18:50.15]Let children learn to judge their own work.
[18:53.10]A child learning to talk does not learn by being corrected all the time:
[18:58.00]if corrected too much, he will stop talking.
[19:00.51]He notices a thousand times a day the difference
[19:04.24]between the language he uses and the language those around him use.
[19:08.06]Bit by bit, he makes the necessary changes to make his language like other people's.
[19:14.08]In the same way, children learning to do all the other things they learn
[19:18.34]to do without being taught¡ª
[19:19.99]to walk, run, climb, whistle, ride a bicycle¡ª
[19:23.81]compare their own  performances with those of more skilled people,
[19:27.53]and slowly make the needed changes.
[19:30.05]But in school we never give a child a chance to find out his mistakes and correct them for himself.
[19:36.29]We do it all for him.
[19:37.93]We act as if he thought that he would never notice a mistake
[19:41.65]unless it was pointed out to him,
[19:43.18]or correct it unless he was made to.
[19:45.59]Let him work it out, with the help of other children if he wants it,
[19:49.74]what this word says, what the answers are to that problem,
[19:53.13]whether this is a good way of saying or doing this or not.
[19:56.85]If it is a matter of right answers,
[19:59.15]as it may be in Mathematics or Science,
[20:01.67]give him the answer book.
[20:03.41]Let him correct his own papers.
[20:05.16]Why should we teachers waste time on such routine work?
[20:08.67]Our job should be to help the child
[20:11.07]when he tells us that he can't find the way to get the right answer.
[20:14.58]Let the children learn what all educated persons must someday learn,
[20:19.28]how to measure their own understanding,
[20:21.69]how to know what they know or do not know.
[20:24.75]Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:30.98]33. What is the best way for children to learn things?
[20:52.38]34. What should teachers do when teaching Mathematics?
[21:12.00]35. According to the speaker, what should the teachers in school do?
[21:32.41]Section C
[21:34.04]Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times.
[21:39.03]When the passage is read for the first time,
[21:41.22]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[21:44.61]When the passage is read for the second time,
[21:47.24]you are required to fill in the blanks numbered from 36 to 43
[21:52.16]with the exact words you have just heard.
[21:55.32]For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to fill in the missing information.
[22:01.88]For these blanks, You can either use the exact words you have just heard
[22:06.89]or write down the main points in your own words.
[22:10.38]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:14.10]you should check what you have written.
[22:16.40]Now listen to the passage.
[22:18.59]It's said very few children survived cancer before the 1970s.
[22:24.06]Improved treatments now show hope of long-term survival
[22:28.11]for almost eighty percent of young cancer patients.
[22:31.50]Yet the chemical drugs and radiation employed to cure their cancers can cause other problems later.
[22:38.83]A newly reported study investigated more than 12 000 grown-ups
[22:43.42]who survived childhood cancers.
[22:45.61]Their average age at the time of the study was twenty-eight.
[22:49.44]The researchers found that sixty-two percent of the cancer survivors
[22:53.71]had at least one chronic health problem.
[22:56.44]And they were eight times as likely as their sisters or brothers
[23:00.48]to encounter life-threatening conditions,
[23:03.33]because chemical drugs can damage bone growth
[23:06.83]during an important period of development,
[23:09.35]and radiation for some cancers can increase the risk of other cancers later.
[23:14.71]Survivors of bone cancers, and cancers of the central nervous system
[23:19.19]were at highest risk for health problems as adults.
[23:23.46]The study also found that girls
[23:25.21]who survived cancer were more likely than boys to have problems later.
[23:29.48]Doctors say newer cancer treatments are a little safer but not much.
[23:34.29]Still, the good news is that many of the conditions
[23:37.79]linked to cancer treatments can be found when they are still treatable.
[23:41.95]According to the author of the study,
[23:44.36]doctors should watch closely for problems
[23:47.09]as childhood cancer survivors get older.
[23:49.60]He says doctors should also be sure
[23:52.01]to provide information about problems
[23:54.20]that a child cancer patient might expect in the future.
[23:57.92]And he says it is especially important for survivors to eat right,
[24:02.62]exercise and not smoke.
[24:04.92]Now the passage will be read again.
[24:07.43]It's said very few children survived cancer before the 1970s.
[24:12.80]Improved treatments now show hope of long-term survival
[24:16.96]for almost eighty percent of young cancer patients.
[24:20.24]Yet the chemical drugs and radiation employed to cure their cancers
[24:28.55]can cause other problems later.

[24:40.34]The researchers found that sixty-two percent of the cancer survivors
[24:44.72]had at least one chronic health problem.
[24:47.13]And they were eight times as likely as their sisters or brothers
[24:51.40]to encounter life-threatening conditions,
[24:54.02]because chemical drugs can damage bone growth
[24:57.52]during an important period of development,
[24:59.92]and radiation for some cancers can increase the risk of other cancers later.
[25:05.29]Survivors of bone cancers, and cancers of the central nervous system
[25:09.55]were at highest risk for health problems as adults.

[26:07.41]Doctors say newer cancer treatments are a little safer but not much.
[26:11.68]Still, the good news is that many of the conditions linked to cancer treatments
[26:16.27]can be found when they are still treatable.

[28:02.51]And he says it is especially important for survivors to eat right,
[28:06.23]exercise and not smoke.
[28:08.64]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[28:11.92]It's said very few children survived cancer before the 1970s.
[28:17.17]Improved treatments now show hope of long-term survival
[28:21.00]for almost eighty percent of young cancer patients.
